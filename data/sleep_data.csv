0,sleeptrain,"It’s been months now of my LO waking at night. I CANNOT figure out the fix and it feels like I’ve tried everything.

She’s 16 months old, sleep trained since 5 months. Goes to sleep independently both at naptime and bedtime. She wakes up at random times (no pattern) pretty much every night. Sometimes 11, sometimes just after midnight…2,3,4, etc. 

If we leave her in there to self soothe, she will basically just roll around and whine for HOURS. She seems uncomfortable more than anything. She seems exhausted and like she WANTS to sleep but can’t. 

If we go in, we can sometimes just rub her back and she will settle down, but tends to whine again as soon as we’re gone. If I rock her, she will go back to sleep, but I try to avoid doing this as I felt like it contributed to us needing to soothe her for her to sleep rather than her doing it herself. 

She wakes up inbetween 7-8 (depending on how long she cried the night before)
Nap is 12:30/1-2:30. Bedtime is 7:30. I’ve tried sticking to age appropriate wake windows. We’ve adjusted her schedule in every way possible. We’ve tried pushing back bedtime, making bedtime earlier, making naptime earlier, making naptime later. It makes no difference. 

I think the temperature is fine in her room. The back of her neck doesn’t feel too hot or too cold when I check on her. Her room is blackout dark, she has a sound machine…

It did coincide with her being weened off her formula/bottles and I wonder if she’s not taking in enough calories anymore to sleep well at night. I don’t know. She’s an extremely picky eater and hardly eats the things that she even does like. We just started her on PediaSure to help. 

I’m desperate for more sleep. I dread going to bed every night because I never know how long I’ll get. It’s starting to affect my mental health.

1,sleeptrain,"So I’m thinking about using the pick up put down method on my almost 6mo but I’m not clear on how long you wait to pick them up if they’re crying?
Do you wait till it’s an angry cry or is there a set time of any amount of crying?

I’m only wanting to do it for bedtime initially as I’m happy for him to nap on me or in the pushchair and once he needs a feed in the night I currently bedshare (although if this works I’d aim to reduce that)

2,sleeptrain,"Hello, as per the title. Yet again 7.5 mo has woken up at 4:45 am. Her day time sleep is quite regular on two naps, but it is almost impossible to get her to sleep to the DWT of 6 am unless she wakes to feed overnight (and by that I mean before 3 am). This has been going on before and after transitioning to two naps, either way she will NOT sleep for more than 10.5 hours a night (with or without overnight wakes) so I think that's the limit I need to work with. I have tried everything - feed and put back in the cot, leave her in the cot, cosleeping, shorter/longer/later nap in the morning, earlier/later bedtime, NOTHING is working. Is it possible that her crawling is disrupting her so much? She started army crawling at 6.5 mo, then teething at 7 mo and now she is desperately trying to crawl on all fours. She falls asleep on her own so I feel like whatever I do will not put her back to sleep but just encourage her to wake up. I don't know if this is a regression, her 4-month one was brutal and it took two months to slowly sleep train her. 

Sample schedule for clarity.

DWT: 6:00/6:15 (latest we could do is probably 6.30? But we need to get ready for daycare)

Nap 1: 9:15/9:30-10:00 (I have been capping this to 45 minutes. Under advice from a sleep consultant I let her sleep longer once, had a 1.15 hour nap and then a split night so never again)

Nap 2: 1:00/1:30-3:00/3:30 (generally has a good solid 2-hour nap here)

Bedtime: about 3.5 hours after waking from nap 2

I am seriously at a loss on what to try next. Right now she is just crying and frantically moving in the cot and I am not even bothering anymore but I refuse to take her out before 6 at least.

4,sleeptrain,"My 2.5 year old has slept through the night with basically no issues since he was 4 months old.. we got very lucky, never dealt with any regressions and night wakings were very rare. About 6 months ago he was starting to fight bedtime (7/7:30) pretty hard and was waking early so we shifted bedtime back to about 8 and that solved our issues.

Now the issue we are having is that one morning a few weeks ago he woke up early and we let him sleep in our bed. Since then, he just wants to be in our bed all of the time and wakes multiple times throughout the night. He was leaving his room and coming to ours each time but we have since put a child lock on his handle so he can't get out. We have an ok to wake clock in place and he understands the concept but he is still waking multiple times a night and standing at his door crying. He is also waking up about an hour earlier than usual most days. I can tell he isn't getting enough sleep because he is crankier than usual and isn't behaving as well as he normally does.

He still naps every day, at daycare it is usually about 2hrs, at home it is about 1-1.25hrs, length of nap doesn't seem to affect things.

5,sleeptrain,"I'm on day 10 of sleep training my 6 month old. We're using a modified Ferber where at the intervals we pick up out down. It does soothe her and has been successful for bedtime. She didn't cry/fuss for more than 10 minutes and now she usually falls asleep within 10 minutes. At the start we rescued wake ups our usual way, bouncing on a yoga ball and rocking in the glider until she is asleep. I would feed twice a night following the 5/3/3 interval. Before sleep training we could get her back to sleep pretty easily.

Fast forward a week into sleep training and at first the MOTN wake ups reduced. Now we are back to 2 wake ups and 2 feeds, however the wake ups are now more difficult to manage. She will fall back asleep but wake up the minute we transfer to the crib. One night I did just feed her to sleep 4 times. So we started Ferber for the MOTN wakes. This has been for the last 2 days. She cries harder than bedtime and she wakes us up, so we don't get anymore sleep than before training. I think we made a mistake and should have Ferberized wake ups from the beginning.

I wanted to ask this community if we are now doing the right thing. If this is part of the course and maybe nights got better because she caught up on sleep and now she's really learning to put herself back to sleep.

Our schedule is 2/2.5/2.5/3. My working assumption is that she needs 14 hours total sleep (2 during the day and 12 at night). She has also been a bad day sleeper. Until 3 months she would only contact nap during the day and at one point I had to walk for hours in the carrier. 

She now does day and night sleep in her crib. We haven't sleep trained for naps but she goes down easier since sleep training. Since 3.5 months she only cat napped 30-40 minutes. At 4.5 months she would do one 1 hour nap a day. Then she started rolling and got Covid and now is back to cat napping. I used to try and rescue at least one nap a day so she gets 2-2.5 hours of nap time. But since sleep training I've been wanted to see how her day time sleep is on her own and it looks like she does around 2 hours (1hr40-2hr20) spread across 3 naps.

At 3.5 months she refused to sleep over 3 hours in the day and dropped her 4th nap (could not get her to sleep even if it meant she was up for 5 hours!). So my assumption is she's a low day sleeper and will transition to 2 one hour naps soon. I also think her 1 hour naps were making up for bad night sleep when we hit the 4 month sleep regression.

She is EBF (won't take a bottle) and has never taken a pacifier. We have black out blinds and a sound machine. A short nap routine. Should I rescue naps? Should I start to Ferberize naps?

Her MOTN wakes ups have been moving to later in the night (only on day 2 mind). We may be experiencing a growth spurt or a 6 month sleep regression. Should we stop Ferberizing MOTN wake ups? She needed one 10 minute check in and went back to sleep in the next 10 minute interval last night.

I've been feeding her around 6 hours into bedtime (around 1am) and then again around 5am. Last night she woke up at 12am (7:30pm bedtime) and took 20 minutes to fall asleep. She woke up at 1:30 and I fed her to sleep. She falls asleep within a few minutes on the boob. She woke up at 6:55. I fed her at 7:10 and she fell asleep. I woke her up at 8am. I think the last feed is not needed and she only needs one but has a feed to sleep association for MOTN wake ups.

I really want her to fall asleep with as little crying and out herself back to sleep without waking us. I also think she needs only one night feed.

6,sleeptrain,"My baby (currently 3,5 months old) had a very rough start with hidden reflux, around 7/8 weeks I stopped eating dairy+soy plus he had a lip tong tie. The first two months were just crying, screaming and contact napping.

With 2 under 2 our life is chaos and my baby still has the worst sleep associations possible. Contact napping, nursing to sleep and/or rocking to sleep. I keep an eye on wake times but life happens with 2 under 2.

Second nap in carrier outside (play time for toddler)
Thirth nap during toddler’s nap, in crib and later contact nap to give him some proper rest

She has been sleeping through the night since she was 8 months old and sleeps around 11-12 hours straight. 1st day in daycare, she only napped for 30 mins. We picked her up from daycare early and gave her a 40 mins nap at home. That night, she woke up at 3am and was up until 5.30am. Rest of the week, she napped around 1.5 hours at daycare, which was normal. We put her to bed her usual time or maybe 10-15 mins early. But every single night, she woke up somewhere between 4-4.30am and stayed up for 1.5-2 hours. 

Previously, if she woke up, she used to put herself back to sleep within a min or so. Now, she either sits in the crib or stands and keeps crying. We give her 20-30 mins to settle (she hasn't calmed down on her own this entire week), then I go and try to console her. If I leave the room, she cries hysterically. So I have gone back and got her to our room and have her co-sleep for rest of the night. I feel this is due to daycare and will resolve on its own. My wife feels this is turning into a habit and our daughter now expects us to attend to her every night. It's also taking a toll on us since both of us work and we're exhausted by staying up 1.5-2 hours every night.

My baby girl (5.5mo) used to wake around 720 pretty regularly up until a few weeks ago. She wakes now between 6 and 630. Before sleep training when we bed shared, I’d feed and hold her until 7ish when we’d start the day and I’d normally count that as the wake time to start the wake window.

But the little one of course got overtired in the process as I put toddler to bed. My baby takes a huge effort to fall asleep and stay asleep. She cries before every nap and it's hard to keep her asleep. this is mainly because of the colic and partly because she's overtired (I pay attention to wake windows but I've accepted that I can't do it perfectly.

I don't know how to reconcile her high and complicated sleep needs with my son.

It's just frustrating when you just got the little one to sleep after a lot of screaming and a Noise or wrong movement wakes her up again which means more screaming. So he's on his tablet a lot but sometimes he is bored and doesn’t want to. Poor boy wants to play with mom. 

But the little one has to sleep most of the day so she is not an overtired mess screaming for hours in the evening (because of the colic this is horrible anyway but thank god the peak is over). i am so scared about the next weeks.

27,sleeptrain,"Pretty much since my daughter turned one, her sleep has been garbage. She is capable of sleeping through the night because she has before. Nothing is different about her schedule on those days. Lately she will wake up between 1-3 and be very difficult to lay back down in her crib. I rock her in the rocking chair and lay her down once she's asleep again. This is lately having a 50/50 success rate as many times this takes multiple attempts. She will just pop back up and expect to be picked up again. It ends up taking two to three hours before we can all go back to bed every night. Im a working mom and I am just absolutely struggling during the day right now 

Her schedule:

Usually wakes at 700-7:30 (on nights when she's up an exceptionally long time she will sleep in until 8)
Nap 1- 10:30 nap for 1-1.5 hours. Occasionally 2 hours
Nap 2- 3:30 or 4, for 30 mins
Bedtime is at 8 pm. This is a rigid time because our work schedules don't allow for an earlier bed time and we would miss spending time with her before bed. She goes down without a fuss for the most part.

We thought maybe she was trying to transition to one nap. We tried a one nap day because she woke up late at 8:30. She napped 12-1:20 and then bed at her usual time. But by dinner time, she was a tired wreck. She's already been up twice tonight so clearly that wasn't it.

Do I need to bite the bullet and sleep train? We previously did at 5 months because we were reluctantly co sleeping and it got her to sleep in her own crib. She's so much older now and clingy and wants comfort often. I hate the idea of doing this to her but if I don't start getting sleep I'm going to lose my ever loving mind.

29,sleeptrain,"Hi everyone! My little guy’s been sleep trained (chair/Ferber method) since 5 months and my only problem was frequent 5am wakes, most of the time he was calm so I’d just let him hang out and pick him up at 6am. He can now stand in his crib. 

He was recently sick so I gave in and would sit in the rocker next to his crib and rock and hold him for a bit when he would wake up from coughing and then put him back down. He would fuss but eventually go back to sleep. Now, he’s been waking up about 1.5-2hrs into his night sleep, stands up and screams/cries until I go in and put him back down (this causes even more of an extreme scream/cryfest) OR I pick him up, hold him for a few minutes, then put him back down, with the same huge protest. Eventually, likely from the exhaustion of crying, he doesn’t stand back up and puts himself to sleep. Problem is, now he does it about 3-4x a night!

Wake windows are 2.75/3/3.5 and he’s pretty good with that, just recently has times where he’ll fight his second nap the same way as his night sleep- standing up and protesting.

37,sleeptrain,"My second son was born at the beginning of October (3 months on the 6th), and he has actually not been a terrible sleeper. He’s been sleeping through the night (with a dream feed) since the doctor said it was ok to let him, and gets 4/5 bottles a day at 5-6 Oz at a time. His naps have always been short comparatively, but that’s been normal for his age and I wasn’t worried. We’d even gotten to a point where his first nap of the day would be at least two hours reliably, and the rest would be at least 40 minutes, a lot of times an hour. 

Over the holidays, we had a lot of travel and everyone ended up sick, including my 3 month old. I ended up having to hold him for almost every nap so he could breathe, and now that’s all he wants. I cannot get him to settle to sleep longer than 5 minutes before he is crying again, or if I do settle him he sleeps for 30 minutes and then cried until I pick him up. Sometimes, he will be rocked fully asleep, but snap right back awake when I try to put him down, full blown inconsolable crying. 

It wouldn’t be such a big deal to hold him for naps if I didn’t have a 3 year old I also need to tend to and who desperately wants to play. My husband works late 6 days a week, so I’m pretty much doing this all on my own.

With our first, we just kind of limped along until we could do sleep training, but again, I can’t do that as well with a 3 year old.

38,sleeptrain,"Okay, so I’m a FTM with a napper from hell. It’s my own personal punishment for not being a very good napper myself, I guess, but ohmyGod I am dying please listen to my plight. 

My son is over 4 months old now (18 weeks, I believe). He’s always been a bad napper. For the first two or so months, he napped exclusively in his swing. It was great. Then around 3 months, his naps shortened to 30 minutes on the dot; you could set your watch by him. By 3.5 months we had fallen into our never ending bouncing on the yoga ball. 

Originally, we just used the ball to calm him when he was freaking out. Then it became a way to get him to sleep before putting him in the swing. Now it’s the only way he will nap, and even now he’s starting to fight it so hard that we can’t even stop bouncing once he’s asleep. I’m starting to understand why those lullabies are so dark; I’ve written a few myself. (You cannot tell me “down will come baby, cradle and all” was not written by a sleep deprived mother.)

Nighttime though actually isn’t that bad. It can take a little bit of back and forth, but once he’s asleep he (usually) doesn’t wake for several hours, and we feed/change him and he (usually) gets back to sleep fine without our intervention (full disclosure, he is in a snoo. But I don’t think it always helps). He still sleeps in our room, and I really wanted to make it to 5-6 months before moving him out, but I feel like if I night sleep train I should move him out, too. 

Thus, I’m wondering: can you sleep train naps before/without doing nights? We don’t have a consistent schedule, and I know that would help, but it mostly comes down to the wake up time. Lately he’s been waking up at 6am and I am so exhausted I can’t get up that early. Generally I go by how long he’s been awake, around 1.5hours and he goes to sleep fairly easily. Bedtime is usually around 6:30, so I don’t let him sleep past 5 if I can help it.

Apologies in advance if this post is a bit of a mess, just trying to include as much info as I can. 

My baby is 21 weeks old and sleeps in a crib in my room. I'm trying to teach my baby how to fall asleep independently and am looking for some advice. Lately my baby has been waking every 1.5-2 hours through the night. I was able to previously get atleast 1-2 stretches of 3-4 hours per a night but now no matter how my baby is put to sleep he is waking frequently, most of the time he wakes he doesnt actually ever open his eyes unless we do a diaper change, his eyes usually remain closed but he is fussing a lot or crying. I do wait a few mins to see if he will settle but he doesnt at which point ill pick him up to feed or rock him. Now this is what happens for middle of the night wakings whereas our routine for initially going to sleep is a bit different. 

At the beginning of the night I put my baby down in the crib, sometimes he is fast asleep as he would have fell asleep while breastfeeding or sometimes he is just drowsy/tired when I put him down. After I put him down if he stirs/wakes up I let him be and let him fuss for about 10-15 mins unless he starts to cry. My baby usually does not full on cry but just keeps fussing/whining. Usually when I go check on him after about 10-15 mins his eyes are closed but he is still fussing. I then try to rock him/sing/shush while he is still in the crib. He will usually settle into a deeper sleep then but after a few mins of me stopping he starts to fuss again. At this point i usually let him fuss for a bit longer before trying again. This usually eventually works but lately seems to be taking longer (last night it took about 40 mins).
I do not pick my baby up until he full on cries or if we have been trying for close to 1 hour. Again his eyes are closed the whole time so I think he is sleeping?? 

I call what I'm doing gentle sleep training as I'm not ready to try extinction methods. My baby rarely full on cries so when he does i take that he is very upset and needs. 

I'm hoping to get some advice on what what I could possibly be doing better to teach him to sleep independently which in turn would hopefully get me some longer stretches of sleep. 

I am very proud of the fact that my baby can get himself to a stage where he closes his eyes all by himself but he still seems to need help going into a deeper sleep.  
He is also learning to roll onto his sides and went through a few days where he would just roll onto his side and soothe himself that way which was working great (I got one night where he slept 5 hours and the next 6 hours with him rolling onto his side and sleeping there!)  but recently when he tries to roll to the side he doesn't stay there (or isn't strong enough to stay in that position?)  and ends up rolling back onto his back and getting upset again.

From the fifth night on she has been having a solid two hour stretch at the beginning of the night and after that she would wake every 20-30 minutes wanting for my boob and/or a pacifier. If I don't give it to her she would fully wake up and start screaming. 
I remember that the same thing happened when we did Ferber. She was really good at the beginning but afte a few days she started the wakings.
Her WW are 2.25-25/2.5/2.5/2.45-3 but i don't think it is a schedule think.For her daytime naps she goes down sometimes independently and some with pacifier and stays asleep maybe for 2 hours. However i tend to cap her naps .
I really dont want a solid night. I don't mind her waking 3-4 times. Or even 5. I just can't haldle her waking every 20 minutes almost all night long. 
Does anyone have a clue why is this happening or how to fix it?? Is this an age  thing? Does it go away on it's own eventually? I am really so desperate and sleep deprived that i cry from her first wake up (cause i know that's it for me) till the morning.
Sorry for the long post...

56,sleeptrain,"We hit 16 weeks today and have our 4 month appointment in a week and a half. The first 14ish weeks were hell with contact napping and overnights. My wife and I were almost off the cliff until 2 weeks ago when our son randomly rolled over onto his stomach one night and slept in 5 hour chunks at night. He even settled himself back down in the middle of the night (once) this week. We cried tears of joy before immediately passing out from exhaustion (and buying every O2 and movement sensor imaginable to quell my wife's anxiety of him sleeping on his stomach).

That being said, our bedtime routine still requires we rock our son to sleep and when he wakes up in the middle of the night we usually have to soothe him (though the timeframe usually overlaps with feeding time). That includes when we first put him down. He'll sleep for 30 minutes, wake up and we'll pat his back for 5-7 minutes and he'll go back to sleep. That cycle usually runs twice at bedtime before I can sneak away. MOTN wake ups usually just require the feeding and then rocking to sleep and then he'll be down for the next 4-5 hours with no consistent second wake up.

So, where do we go from here? Ideally we'd like to be able to put our son down without playing the ""is he actually asleep"" game followed by not stepping on the wrong squeaky floorboard on our way out of the room. I'm just worried we try Ferber or CIO and it doesn't work and we blow up the relatively manageable situation we're in now. Especially if he doesn't happen to roll onto his stomach and then we add in the damn moro reflex and general dislike of back sleeping.

Also, naps are terrible. Can set my watch to him waking up at 30-32 minutes. Because of that our wake windows and schedule don't always run smoothly. We aim for an 8am wake up and then windows spaced out to get us to a 30 minute cat nap ending about 2ish hours prior to bed time around 8/8:30.",Getting Ready For ST,1673194276.0

59,sleeptrain,"Hi everyone,

My daughter is turning 5 month son Jan 19. We did a graduated extinction method of sleep training and it has improved her going to bed tremendously. Previously, she was being bounced to sleep and would cry the whole time. Now we do our routine and put her down, and she has been falling asleep under 10 minutes for a couple weeks. Her schedule is wake up at 7:30 then 2/2.25/2.25/2. She sleeps between 2-3 hours daytime sleep. But I have run into a few other issues lately..

&#x200B;

1. Increase in Night Wakings- Before sleep training, she slept through the night. The battle was getting her to sleep in the first place. She started waking up once a night a few weeks ago at around 4 am for a feed, which is completely fine and normal. Now she has been waking up twice a night around 2 am and then around 5 am. I go in and feed her right away for both and she goes back to sleep. I am assuming she is just hungry BUT I wonder if it is part of the regression or if I reinforced this somehow and it is not more of a habit? I ask because she has slept longer stretches before. Her day feeds seem the same. I know babies up to 6 months wake 1-2 nights normally, but since she was sleeping through the night or only waking once, I am wondering what the cause of two night wakings could be. 
2. Last wake window is always the shortest- I know this one is supposed to be the longest to build sleep pressure. When we first started sleep training, she was happy during her bedtime routine most of the time and her last wake window she was pretty content and seemed well rested. Now, an hour into her last wake window she starts getting fussy and only wants to be held. She seems tired and cranky and stretching that window is hard, so she goes down earlier, usually between 6:30 and 6:45 consistently.
3. Crying during bedtime routine- She also has started crying right when we start the last diaper change of the day and cries through putting her pajamas and sleep sack on and her feed and calms down a bit during her books. Prior to sleep training she was doing this too. I was so happy when she stopped, but now she has started again. 
4. Inconsistency when falling asleep- Even when her day sleep and routines seem the same, she sometimes takes 6-7 minutes to fall asleep without crying or with some complaining (the goal) but then other times she will take 25 minutes of heavy crying on and off and I feel I am at square one and can't figure out what the issue was.

60,sleeptrain,"Please help, I don’t know where I’m going wrong. I think we’re in the 12m regression or heading for a transition. Things are so inconsistent, despite best efforts. Naps are all over _and_ he’s having early morning wakes (EMW) half of the week. The schedule is roughly below. He’s 1 next week. 


- 6:15 DWT (but half the week he’s waking upset at 05:40)
- 9:30 - 10:45 NAP 1
- 2:30-3:15 - NAP 2 (sometimes a bit earlier)
- 7:30 BED (a later or earlier bedtime has never helped)


Further clues if interested:

* He’s always been a grade B+ sleeper - naps and nights independent, good routine, 75th % for weight, never wakes in the night since weaning at 6 months yet has struggled with EMW. He can do a 10.5 hour night, that’s his jam. I loved being BTC for naps but now the clock seems to have broken.

* Today he woke at 05:40 after a short night and had a short wake-up at 10pm
(very clingy - he never dies this) And today totally fought his first nap despite eye-rubbing. He finally dropped off at 10:30, so a 4 hour WW (or 4.5 if you include the false EMW)

* Morning nap is crazy: sometimes hard to wake from/ sometimes wakes naturally at 1h20/ sometimes does an hour. Afternoon naps are sometimes becoming the longer one; and then other days he only does 30 mins. Today, he was rubbing his eyes at the second nap after only a 3 hour wake window, but spent 20 minutes sat up before he literally fell over asleep.

* At bedtime he’s doing this crazy new thing of trying to leap off my knee out the chair and carry on playing. But he’s had a 4.5 hour WW. And seems tired. Is this a red herring and he just loves play?

* He’s not yet in daycare but does start next week for 2 days. They don’t make much effort to try keep your schedule, and said they don’t force babies to sleep - so totally the opposite of me with my white noise, pacifiers, nap routine etc 🤯. Most of the babies in his room with follow daycare’s 12-2 nap on mats, they told me

**Some friends say go to one nap but how do you know which days to try that? He doesn’t seem fully ready. And some say it’s not a sign of one nap, it’s just a regression. I feel like I need a crib sheet of “if this happened then do *X*, but if this is happened then today do *Y**

62,sleeptrain,"My baby was sleep trained at 4 months and did about 10.5-11 hours with no wakings/feeds. She is now 8.5 months and transitioned to 2 naps about a month ago. It was going amazing at first. The past 2 weeks or so, however, my baby has had night wakings. First it was 11pm, then 10pm, then multiple nights of 9pm, then multiple nights of 3am. We initially responded after 10-15 minutes of crying since we assumed there was a problem. She was cutting a third tooth. But since then we've tried CIO (we did this when she was first sleep trained) but it's having minimal effect. She cried 45 minutes one night, the other morning she cried over an hour until about 4:30am when my husband was convinced she must be hungry, so I fed her and put her back to bed where she cried another 30 minutes. Last night she woke at 10pm and cried over 2 hours before she went back to sleep for good. She had a few minutes here and there when it seemed like she was asleep but she'd wake again. 

Schedule is 2.75/3.25/3.5. She naps 3.25 hours and we have to wake her from her naps (the first is between 90-120 minutes and the second is however long she can have until she hits 3.25). She goes down for sleep really well. Minimal to no fussing. 

I'm exhausted and at a loss of what to do. No teeth in sight now (though the third isn't 100% in yet) and no sickness. She is happy and content during the day so I don't think she's in pain from teething)though she is chewing on everything).

63,sleeptrain,"My 15 month old got really off-schedule with naps during the holidays when we had family visiting and we were out of the house for basically the entire week. 

Then on NYE, he was diagnosed with a double ear infection and croup. He had to be held for sleep the entire night. His sleep got a little better after starting meds then changed drastically for the worse over the course of a week. My theory is his illnesses cleared up but he got used to being held and cuddled for naps and some of the nighttime while sick. We were putting him to bed asleep after rocking because he was pretty miserable. 

He also had his 15 month appointment a few days ago and the doctor said his bottom molars are coming in but his cough and ear infections are basically cleared up. We’ve been giving him Tylenol/Motrin at night for teething so I don’t think that’s totally to blame. 

A few nights ago, we half-ass attempted CIO but I gave up after about an hour or so and held him the entire night again. The next night, I decided to get serious. He cried for an hour before sleeping through. Then at nap time, he cried for 90 minutes before my MIL (who was watching him) gave up and let him sleep on the couch next to her. Last night, he cried during his entire bedtime routine and then for 20 mins and then slept through. But he’s losing his voice from crying and is pretty clingy so far today. This leads me to believe he’s got a bad case of separation anxiety. He’s pretty happy once he’s actively engaged. 

He’s been trained since 4.5 months with Ferber but check ins at this age just make him more upset. I know some people believe in check ins for separation anxiety but I truly believe it just makes it worse and he’ll expect more comfort (as he’s proven this last week). 

I’m also out of the house almost all day while I finish up a full house renovation and we are living with my in laws. My MIL pretty much watches him the entire day until early evening. I’d love to be around for extra daytime comforting but it’s not possible. 

Any tips for making him more comfortable during retraining? Or does anyone have experience with this and can offer some positive stories?

ETA: just spoke with my MIL about what she might do for naps today and she admitted to me that she rocks him to sleep for all his naps. No wonder he’s generally been a not-so-good napper the last few weeks.

Just as he turned 5 months old he had 2 nights of rough night wakes that he couldn’t fall back asleep even after feeding. He normally falls asleep independently for all naps and bed time. I realized he needs more wake time and less naps (even though they are usually short). We went to 1.5/1.75/2/2.25 and have been doing close to that for 3 days. Day 1 and 2 we got false start. I ended up feeding him more milk and he slept till 4 am quick feed and then slept till 730. Day 3 no false start!

I’m hoping he will start sleeping through soon but I am wondering how I can help drop these midnight/4 am feeds. He is legit hungry and with one less nap we get one less wake window for a bottle. We are slowly introducing solids so maybe that will help. 

Currently feeding approximately 5 oz at 6 am 
4.5 at 8:15
5 oz after nap 1, 6 after nap 2 if he does longer one, 5 after nap 3 and then another bottle just before bed right after his bath which he takes 2-4 oz. This adds to 25-30oz which is good but he still seems to want the night feed. Also when he’s slept through before 7-7 I wouldn’t be able to squeeze in that 6 am bottle and it will be hard to get in those ounces. Trying to feed oatmeal in last wake window as well and fruit purée daytime but he only takes a few spoons.

68,sleeptrain,"my baby was sleep trained using ferber at 5 months and goes down at bedtime no problem. When our routine was solid he’d sleep for at least 8-10 hours (max). He’d then wake up around 3 am for a night feed… then another snooze feed at 5:30 am ish. Up for the day around 6:30-7. This routine I actually didn’t mind. 

Now, we recently went away to the uk (from canada) for a month and had to re-sleep train while there. By the end of the trip it turned into him waking up around 11:45 pm-12 am for first feed, then 3 am for second. Then up for the day around 5:50 am. 

We’ve been back home now for a few days and he’s done well adjusting his sleep, however I’m now I’m getting so exhausted by him waking up at night. It’s always a toss up whether he’ll sleep another 1.5 hours or another 3. And there is 100% a morning feed.

Now, he doesn’t seem to self soothe at all. Instead as soon as I lay him down he freaks out and screams and cries. It almost seems like he’s scared? And he pushes his head against the edge of the crib so hard. He seems to pass out from exhaustion instead of self soothing. So as soon as he wakes it’s back to screaming.

We did that because it was just easy to get ANY sleep at the time. Now, the last couple of nights, he's soooo much harder to get to sleep and stay asleep.

My LO is 8 months and we were away for a week where there was no schedule. Pretty much took naps whenever she showed sleep cues and bed time varied.

Ideally her schedule should be :

7 am : wake

10 am - 11 am : nap 1

2 pm- 3pm : nap 2

6:30 bedtime routine

7pm : asleep

Here’s the problem. She wakes at 7 and can’t stay awake past 8 am… for the last two days she cries until I nurse and rock her to sleep.

98,sleeptrain,"Hi all. Back again to talk about our sleep struggles. For context (from some of my other posts, too), our LO has *never* taken a daytime nap longer than 40 minutes. It's usually 25-30 minutes, but we've had a few 40 minutes in there (progress?)

I would love/appreciate any input here. He's about to hit his 4 months, but our regression started last week (I think). I 100% know that regression is really hard, but I just don't know what to do anymore. The fact that he's never been able to have a full nap has already been so difficult, because we usually have to fight him to get back down, and then just hold him to get him to nap longer. But now, when he wakes from his naps, he's so mad. He just cries so hard, and no matter what, he's just inconsolable. At times, we have to give up after 30-40 minutes of trying. As you can imagine, this just leads to a cranky bear, and it gets worse and worse each nap until he's just completely inconsolable at night. We're not able to get any solid sleep habits in.

Does anyone that has a fellow catnapper, have anything you can share after going through regression? What do we do to help get him down faster? He needs a lot more rocking and walking, but sometimes, that doesn't work (it took 1hr15 minutes to get him to sleep last night *after* his bedtime routine).

Some notes -

We have a consistent nighttime routine (wakes from short nap, feed, awake time, quick bath, lotion + jammies, book in dim light, sound machines shushing and rocking).

There are really rare times, but he's been able to fall asleep with his eyes open as we practice ""awake but drowsy"" but maybe has only happened twice.

To add - he suddenly is refusing his pacifier, so is much harder to soothe. We are unable to do the 5s's successful, as for some reason it just makes him madder than just holding him against our bodies. We do swaddle but leave one arm out as he's about to roll (we think)

My baby is 5 months tomorrow, but was born premature at 35+5 so he will be 4 months adjusted. 

I am wondering what the best way is to handle appointments/activities that fall during his first nap time - we signed up before establishing any consistencies in his schedule. They will run until March, so I’d like to be able to continue with them since it’ll be a temporary disruption on two days a week.

We usually start the day around 8 am, have a 1.5 hour wake window so he goes down for his first nap around 9:30. The class/activity on Tuesdays and Saturdays start at 10:00 so 9:15-9:30 would be around the time we need to leave for the swim lessons or baby clsss that we signed up for. 

I will likely get home from these activities around 11:15-11:30. He doesn’t nap well in the car seat or stroller but naps decently in a wrap. We need to drive on Saturdays but on Tuesdays I can possibly walk - though that also means I’d need to leave much earlier. 

There’s no consistency in his first nap length yet. Sometimes it’s 1 hour, sometimes it’s 35-40 minutes. He seems to be starting to have longer naps and over the holidays we’ve had first naps as long as 1.5 hours but those are still rare. 

I seem to have two options:

- wake early at 7:00 on those days so he takes his first nap at 8:30. Cap at 9:15 and leave for activity. Possible 2 hour ww before  next nap at 11:15-11:30

- try to let him sleep until 9:00? This one seems difficult. 

He goes down for bedtime around 8. 

Either way I don’t think it’ll be a great situation since his wake window doing the activity will be too long. I know I’ll likely deal with some overtiredness on those days.

103,sleeptrain,"Hello! We have a curious, active boy who just turned 1 in mid-December. Over the past week, we’ve seen some really strange napping patterns that are increasingly difficult to manage. 

First, I must confess that we’re still rocking him to sleep, although we do plan to wean it off him in the next few months. Even so, he’s been able to sleep through the entire night, starting from anytime between 8.30-9.30pm to 7 or 7.30am; this has been going on more or less consistently for a couple of months. He’s never been too much trouble in the middle of the night, which is the main reason why we never really turned to sleep training. We also give him a big bottle shortly before bed, and while it used to knock him out, it doesn’t do so anymore. 

So here’s the thing:

- His wake window before the first nap of the day keeps getting longer. He rarely gets tired before the 4th hour.

- He is in daycare and with the number of kids they handle, they tend to follow cues instead of a fixed schedule. This has not tended to be a problem until recently, since 

- He is fighting the second nap but still tends to need it — yet, making him take it pushes bedtime to 1h, 1.5h later than usual. We usually aim for 8.30pm, but for the last few nights it’s been 9.30

- Today, he started his first nap at 11.40am, rose at 1, took a half hour catnap in the car at 5 and woke at 5.30, and  barely displayed fatigue cues… finally got him down after a good deal of fussing and rocking at 10.15pm. Was he perhaps not tired enough? Is this possible!? 

- Did I mention that he hates bedtime? Will start screaming during the change into his pjs. Screams, fusses, during rocking until he is inevitably drowsy from the motion. It takes an eternity to get him down through petting him in the crib and has never really worked, but maybe we have not persisted enough. 

- The only part of the bedtime routine he enjoys is the bath. It’s more fun than relaxing, tbh.

I am sitting in the hallway in the doorway of my kid's room. My kid will stay in bed and fall asleep like this, but he will cry if he wakes up and sees the door closed. Sometimes this is less than ten minutes after I leave. When I eventually move the chair out of sight, this won't change that he will want me to stay seated in the hall the entire time he sleeps and get upset if I don't respond to his verbal cues or if his door is closed. (I know this because this is the second time we are trying this method after another sleep regression.) 

I also don't see how this method might help decrease the number of nighttime wakeups. My kid right now is waking up 3-5 times a night and requiring us to sit in the chair for 30-90 minutes at a time. 

We know how to go through the sequence, but what does SLS look like when it's ""completed""? Sitting in a chair in the hallway doesn't do that much for us if we have to stay here each time he wakes up and until he falls asleep and stays asleep long enough for us to sleep.

Now, our ~~6mo~~ 10mo seems to have taken the initial lesson to heart, and he goes to sleep very easily at the start of the night.

Last night we tried full extinction but gave up after two solid hours of screaming.

Pediatrician OK’d sleep training and night weaning (though I don’t want to night wean yet). We sleep trained with CIO 10 days ago and it was relatively easy/successful and he is now sleeping independently. Worst day was 21 minutes of crying at bedtime. 

- Bedtime routine: nurse, lullaby, diaper/jammies/sleep sack, book then crib (in his own room) by 7:30PM
- Now falls asleep independently after under 10 minutes of fussing 
- Wakes 2-3x overnight for feeds (longest stretch is 3-4 hrs on a good night)
- Daily wake time 6-7AM
- Naps remain a mess. They are contact or stroller only. We aim for reasonable wake windows of ~2 hrs but he is routinely awake for 4+ hours at a time (often happily until the end). Averaging about 1.5 hrs of day sleep per day. Not sleep training naps yet, just trying to make them happen however we can.

He often wakes up briefly in the early night (9PM ish) and since he ate < 3 hrs ago, we give him ~10 min to try to self-settle. He almost always does. 

However, he’s used to eating every 3 hrs and on these wakes he will not self settle after 10+ minutes. So we try to feed him promptly. 

He usually falls back asleep while nursing. I put him back down in crib while mostly asleep but will try to rouse him a little. 

He often starts crying again a few minutes after being put down. Since he was just fed, we are letting him self-settle. These times are often 20+ minutes of hard crying which is really difficult for us to endure. We sometime cave and go pick up again. It’s really hard esp after 4AM when sleep drive is down and I often end up just holding him for a couple hours for contact sleep. 

I’m worried we will confuse him/make things worse with the inconsistent responses to wake ups. Do we need to ignore all crying post-feeds? What about when it happens in early morning and he’s crying for so long? Let him cry until wake up time?

Schedule usually is: 

Wake 6:30/7
Nap: 11-2
Bed: 7

She does better on one nap than two, but we aren’t 100% fully consistent with that yet (trying! Having a toddler, baby, WFH with kids makes it HARD), so there are occasional days where naps are more around 10-11:30, and 2-3, so day time sleep is usually around the same length when this does sometimes happen. Frankly, I also prefer her on a one nap schedule so her and my toddler sleep at roughly the same time and I get a break (or can get some work done). And in case it’s asked, I didn’t put her on a one nap schedule, I wanted to keep her on two until she was at least a year, but she transitioned herself (I think she just wants to be with big brother as much as she can!). 

She’s been treating her MOTN wake up like a full wake window. If I’m lucky, she’s back down within an hour. She usually maxes out at four. There’s been MANY nights where after an hour plus of trying, I just resort to taking her to the living room and letting her play because fighting to get her back down is twice as exhausting. 

Alternatively, she’ll fall back asleep in my arms right away, but will not transfer at all. I’m talking 15+ attempts with immediate crying, and then back to sleep within 15 second when picked up. It’s almost 10pm here right now and between my husband and I, we’re at probably a dozen attempts since 7:45pm.

Modified CIO/Ferber-ish - letting her cry for increasingly long periods (hasn’t worked)
Check ins with and without picking her up.
Staying in the room and verbally reassuring her. 
MOTN feeds. 
Pick her up just until she’s calm then put her back, repeat ad nauseum. 
Rocking fully to sleep and transferring during MOTN wake ups (HA as if, mom).
Adjusting day time naps, with no luck. 
Bed sharing upon MOTN wake (just wide awake and thinks it’s playtime) - in general, this is the most successful way to get her back down in a reasonable time, but I’d prefer her getting back down on her own. 
Trying to make her extra tired before bed (lots of playing, take a walk, practice walking, reading etc). 

She is bottle fed and will usually fall asleep with her bedtime bottle and transfer easily. We’ve also tried giving her bed bottle earlier, but no luck with anything changing.

Up until a few days ago, my baby (currently 6 weeks 3 days) slept pretty decently at night. She was predictable for the most part and we could rely on 3-4 hr stretches. She would go down in her crib for the first stretch after a bath and a bottle. Then she’d be up around midnight or 1/2 am. We’d put her in the bassinet in our room at this point.

On top of being terrified of SIDS, I’m also worried that all of this will set her back and all the work we’ve been doing to lay a foundation for sleep will be ruined.

132,sleeptrain,Hello! We did Ferber at 5 months with good success. Baby’s now 8 months old and on 2.5/3/3.5 with 7am wake and about 8pm sleep. His two naps have been amazing (reliably about 1.5 hrs/each) until the past 3 days. Now both his naps are 35-50 mins long! Is this a regression?  Is he ready for longer wake periods? He always seems sleepy for his naps…,Suddenly short naps,1673046085.0
133,sleeptrain,"So we are about 3 weeks post sleep training and it's been great. Our 5 month old falls asleep without crying now every night, sorts out his own false start (cries for a few min), and then for MOTN feeds I just quickly feed him then pop him back in his crib awake and he goes back to sleep.

BUT... he is now consistently waking up three times a night to feed! Not only that but he generally doesn't let my husband bottle feed him at night so I'm on the hook for every wake up. I go back to work at the end of Jan so we need to stop this.

Bedtime is around 7/7.30 and wakeups are around 11, 2, 4 then up for the day at 6 or 7.

Obviously he can sleep through the night and was doing that before the sleep regression. We had a solid month of only one wake up at around 3 or 4 (though his bedtime back then was around 10pm)

During the day he naps 4x 30-50 min with 2hr WWs (his natural rythym, I don't schedule naps). I think he doesn't take enough milk at each feed (EBF with occasional formula to plug gaps or top up) because he gets distracted or seems not hungry, only to get hungry 1.5hrs later.

139,sleeptrain,"My very clingy contact napper just turned 6 months last week. The last 6 months have been some of the hardest of my life. I remember thinking there would be no way out of contact naps or spending hours to help her fall asleep. I made sure everything was right. Wake windows, feedings, gas, night time sleep, day time sleep, starting solids, rice cereal, weighted sleep sacks, lavender essential oil, all the things. 
CIO didn’t feel like the right move for us. All love for those that do pursue that method, it just didn’t feel right for our family and I was just determined to find another way. She is a very affectionate child and I didn’t want to lose that in her. So, I buckled down and accepted the new normal. I would just forever have to help her fall asleep and be available to help her stay asleep when she woke up. “Drowsy but awake” was literally a fantasy! I breastfed her to sleep most of the time because that’s just what worked for us (I know I know). All of a sudden she stopped wanting to do that. She would be wide awake at the breast despite being well overdue for a nap and surely tired. I could not get her to fall asleep for the life of me, my husband usually had to step in because she would just associate me with food and become more stimulated. Then, one day, after trying for so long to get her to sleep I set her down in her crib to take a phone call. 8 minutes later I check the baby monitor and she’s passed out!!!!!! It was literally the best feeling ever!! She was just ready. No crying it out. No torturous screams. No mom guilt. She was just ready. And since then, I change her diaper, put her in her sleep sack, set her in the crib and and say “night night time” and after a few wiggles and some grunts, she’s out like a light. I never thought I’d be in this position. 
I say all this to just say, follow your gut momma! I spent hours looking through all the tips and tricks, checking all the Reddit forums for anything that would help me, that felt right, without checking in with her. She was just ready on her own time and it worked out! 6 very long excruciating months but it worked! After all, no one said having a baby would be easy. Keep trying and check on your baby!!

141,sleeptrain,"The issue: For the last several months, my LO has been having HUGE problems with sleep. She won’t go down unless we lay next to her crib until she falls asleep. She goes to bed at a normal time (8pm). She’s not overtired. Putting her to bed (even a nap) has become a battle of life and death to her. Her screams sound like she’s being ripped apart. They’re so bad we fear her voice will become raspy. At night, her schedule is like this: Goes to bed at 8… screams until 8:30. Finally asleep by 8:45-9pm. Every night around 10:30-11pm, she wakes up screaming. We go up and put her paci in her mouth or comfort her with a back rub. She goes back to sleep pretty quickly. Then, every night between 2-4am, she wakes up screaming bloody murder, like someone is hurting her badly. These are screams that give me goosebumps and instinctive anxiety that my kid is being tortured. My and my husband’s adrenaline skyrockets. One of us goes up to her. At this point the paci doesn’t help. We need to rub her back or speak sweetly to her until she falls asleep again. And we cannot leave the room. She wakes herself up every two min to make sure we haven’t left the room until she’s finally so exhausted she falls asleep again. 

What we’ve done so far: We have an established routine that we follow well. She naps during the day from 1-2:30/3, which is normal. We’ve adjusted jammies in case too cold or too hot. We’ve given 8 hour Motrin in case it’s teething. We’ve played music. We’ve gone back and forth between night-bottle and no night-bottle (not an actual bottle but sippycup of milk). We’ve slept in her room on the floor by her crib. We’ve made sure she’s not hungry. No matter what, she still wakes at those times and screams heart out. Is it night terrors?? Nightmares? 

We aren’t getting sleep. We are building dread and resentment around “night night.” It’s torturing us as her parents. Please — does anyone have any advice?? I know she’s going on 2years old and the terrible twos are a thing, but I can’t imagine this is normal, esp for how long it’s lasted.

143,sleeptrain,"First time posting but I've read multiple threads and topics and can't seem to find a situation similar to me. 

I've got 3 kids (2 are fine) but my youngest 16 month old is the problem. He has his own room and is still in a crib. We are currently at 1 nap (typically 1.5 to 2 hrs) and start sleep around 8:00pm. He is breastfed with a mix of soft foods. He does follow a pretty standard night routine . . . dinner, light play, bath, feed, sleep. 

The issue is he is not able to self sooth. He doesn't do any pacifiers or thumbsucking (at least consistently). He has a very inconsistent nap and sleep cycle. During his nap he walks up between 0.5 to 1 hr after waking and at night he wakes up between 12am, 4am, 5am. etc. What ends up happening is when he wakes up, I change him, my wife feeds him, and then I rock him to sleep. I agree holding him is the very last thing I should be doing, but I'm out of options. I can't get him back to sleep. We started patting him down at first and he's good but slowly he requires us to hold him. And the time we hold him to fall asleep is getting longer and longer sometimes 0.5 to 1 hr. If we don't do this he'll be so distraught that even holding him is impossible and it could take much much longer for him to get out of his tantrum and sleep.

I've tried the methods listed here but I can't grasp what I should or shouldn't be doing. If I let him cry it out he'll just bang his head against the crib until we can get him to stop. (We asked the doctor, this appears to be normal for toddlers because of the lack of communication skills and there are no cognitive issues ). Patting  him down doesn't work and I don't want to hold him because it reinforces the very behavior I'm trying to mitigate. So now what? Me being in the room isn't enough. I can't hold his hand and his tantrums get worse and worse. . .

145,sleeptrain,"Hi all,

Big thank you in advance as I've been lurking and reading many posts and comments. This has naturally led me to overthink. 

Dad to a 12 weeker tomorrow (or 11 weeks if you count born at 39 weeks? but thats full term so I don't know.) He's a healthy formula eater - 15 pounds. I've seen Healthy sleep habits happy child pop up a lot and so I got it. I gotta admit....it is confusing but that could be me sleep deprived. We were doing much of what it said to do already. I'm just trying to tweak things so I can get some sleep. 

I'll be honest - schedule varies by an hour or two daily based on wake time. It takes me a bit to get out of bed and my son a bit to progress from fuss to actual cry (I jump out if he cries). I do base my life around these consistent feeds. 

* Total ounces daily are either 30 or 35. 35 when he wakes up in the middle of the night, 30 when he sleeps through to 6am or 7am. 
* In crib by 8pm nightly. bedtime routine always starts around 7. Bottle then bath or bath then bottle. 
* Dream feed nightly around 11p. This is a lights off, minimal stimulation feed. Normally he's zonked. 
* In crib by 8pm nightly. bedtime routine always starts around 7. Bottle then bath or bath then bottle depending on last bottle
* When bedtime bottle was 6p and dream at 1130p, he woke up the second I touched him. Took an hour to go back down and he was up again at 3am. My thought was too long between last feed and sugar was low enough that he was hungry, and dream feed woke him too much?
* Lately the 11p dream feed has been causing him to poop. which he always wakes up at 4am with.
* 5 ounces is his sweet spot. I tried 6 ounces twice today and he got hiccups both times. 5.5 ounces and he tends to spit up more. He does finish everything a majority of the time. 

Let me know if any of this logic is off:

I'm thinking of gradually moving his crib time up 15 minute intervals to find sweet spot, as the book suggested earlier bed means longer sleep. then a dream feed at 10p. 

Would a dream feed half the normal bottle decrease the overnight poops? Or just leave him hangry for more?

I'm just confused. When he gets 35 ounces with a dream feed and 4am wakeup, why the 4am wakeup the following morning? But then when he sleeps through and has 30 ounces including dream feed, no wakeup unless he poops.",Healthy sleep habits happy child guidance...,1673030775.0
146,sleeptrain,"From the time my baby was 3 months until just before 6 months, she was a perfect sleeper. Slept in her own crib for all naps and slept throughout the entire night (maybe one feeding while she was asleep sometimes) in her crib. Then one day, and I remember the moment so well, as soon as I laid her down she screamed and cried like she was scared and would not go back to sleep. At the time she still fit in her bassinet so I let her sleep in her bassinet next to me (one of the ones that goes next to your bed and the side opens). Ever since that night, she has never slept on her own for both naps and bed. She quickly outgrew her bassinet and now sleeps in bed with me and my husband. 

I love my baby, I love sleeping next to her, and I love that she feels safe with me. If this was sustainable I would continue doing this. But I want her to be able to sleep without me. I'm also going back to work in February and wanted her to be sleeping in her room again by then but I'm no closer now than I was back in October. I'm seriously trying, but it's been months and nothing is working.

I have tried the drowsy but awake thing, I tried the Ferber method for 2 weeks (just endless crying, didn't help at all), I try rocking her to sleep and holding her until she's completely knocked out. I've swaddled her to sleep (unswaddled when laying her down, just ""swaddled"" to keep her arms down because she likes to grab things and keeps herself awake), used different sound machines (works so well but only when she's in my arms or in my bed), different thicknesses of sleep sacks/pjs. I've tried letting her play in her crib/room during the day to try to create positive associations. None of that has worked. When we're in bed at night she rolls around reaching for me and then wiggles her way over to me to cuddle. I get so little sleep because even when she's asleep I'm awake or only in light sleep so that I can wake up constantly and check on her. One thing I noticed is that back when she slept on her own she would suck her thumb to self soothe and every time she would fuss she'd just pop her thumb in her mouth and fall back asleep. She's not sucked her thumb once since the day she stopped sleeping in her crib. 

Please don't lecture me on safe sleep because I'm trying. But I'm a student and my husband works a dangerous job, we need sleep and this is the only way we can get it right now. I always try to get her to sleep in her crib but there's only so much crying I can take before I feel like I'm causing her so much distress.

Wanted to do nap training as I don’t have time to assist every nap. I have a toddler and life to live. He’ll only nap in the carrier walking consistently not doing chores or on my boob in bed/chair in dark quiet room. So I started but it felt like he was getting way too overtired so I stopped after day 1 of nap training… I feel bad to try and fail but I read an article in science of sleep that made me feel like I should wait until he has independent sleep at night figured out.
Nap 1 put down at 6:45 then slept 7:30-7:56
Nap 2 put down at 9:20 and slept 9:45-10:15
Tried rescuing each one to extend but it didn’t work
Nap 3 in carrier 11:25-1:07 (short ww as he was falling asleep during his feed 
Nap 4 in stroller 4:04-4:26

Started day at 6 as he wasn’t going back to sleep 

Day 3 naps
Nap 1 Nursed to sleep in chair 7:20-7:30 but failed transfer to crib
Nap 2 nursed to sleep in bed 9:16-11:14
Nap 3 carrier 1-1:24 he woke early because I adjusted him off my boob to be more comfortable and stopped walking 
Nap 4 in carrier but started him not on the boob 3:15-3:56
Sleep train night 3 put him down at 5:35 as he seemed super tired with red eyebrows rubbing face fussy 
Cried for 70 min so fell asleep at 6:45 (he had a moment at like 45 min where he fell asleep for 1 min then got up wtf)
Slept solid until 11:20 fed with a little crying after transfer
Woke again at 2:50 and fed then cried a tad after transfer 
Woke at 5:15. I prob should have just tried to let him work it out but felt pointless. I fed him and he didn’t even fall back asleep nursing.

Also, I want to try sleep training again now that she’s older and eating solids so she should be able to sleep on a full tummy.

153,sleeptrain,"Hi all,

our little one is 15 weeks old and about a week ago night and day sleep have become really, really (like really) bad. He takes 25 min crap naps, night starts with numerous false starts, followed by max. 4 hr stretch and after that hourly wake up for nursing and can't be put back to bed (previously he would easily go back into his crib and sleep for another 2-3 hrs).

I am planning on ST once he is 4 months but I'm wondering if there is anything age appropriate I could do now already to help with nights? Or not unless bedtime is independent?

Schedule: 4 naps, 1.5/1.5-1.75/1.75/1.75-2/2-2.25 

I've tried to shorten the wake windows as I am aware they are rather long for his age but he just won't fall asleep sooner unless I put him in a stroller or carrier. With his crap naps he sums up to 3 hrs nap sleep per day which doesn't appear to be enough :-(

Any advice?

154,sleeptrain,"I need help. I have no idea where to even start with sleep training. I definitely prefer a gentler method and a no-cry sleep solution. My son is 11 months old, won't take a pacifier (nursing usually would calm him down but has been working less and less lately). He wakes up usually every 2 to 3 hours throughout the night and nurses back to sleep. We usually start out laying him down in his crib but throughout the night we end up tired and just let him sleep with us. 

Here's the catch: daycare doesn't have him on a good nap schedule. He wakes up around 7:30/8:00am. He naps usually 30 minutes from around 9:00am until 9:30am. ""Naptime"" in the infant room at daycare is from 12:00 pm until 2:30pm, and my son usually wakes up after sleeping for an hour. I didn't realize this, but I think the worker who works in the afternoon has been doing cry-it-out with him, resulting in him not getting another nap. So when I pick him up at 5:30/6:00pm he hasn't slept since 1. Once we get home we are scrambling to get him fed and in bed at 8:00pm (usually we calm him down and get him to sleep around 9:00pm). When I brought it up at daycare today that they were letting him cry it out, they informed me that once he moves up to the toddler room next month they won't rock him to sleep anymore so he needs to learn to sleep on his own. 

I'm sorry; I know this was a long cluttered mess but if anyone could offer any advice I would greatly appreciate it. I was tolerating him waking up so frequently throughout the night because I thought he would eventually just grow into their nap schedule.

155,sleeptrain,"We are having some major bedtime issues with my 7 month old. It's been about 3 months now of false starts and we are at a loss on how to fix this. Every night she wakes up 45 minutes after bedtime. Often screaming. Or crying that escalates to screaming. She then doesn't fall back asleep unless I a) nurse her to sleep and try to transfer her back (often unsuccessful) or b) treat that like a nap and have a 1.5-2 hour wake window. We've tried adjusting the schedule in every which way. At this point, I think it's not just about the schedule, but about the ability to fall back asleep when she wakes up.

We have never formally sleep trained her, yet she falls asleep by herself. Lights off, white noise on, sing a song and place her in her crib, and she's typically asleep within 2-5 minutes. This is for naps and bedtime. Nap lengths range from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the time of day.

164,sleeptrain,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post here - but given I'm crying every night, I think its time to ask for some help from people who may have experienced this too. 

My little girl is 8mo. She is EBF and has one hell of a nursing sleep association. 

History: She has ONLY ever settled on the boob. The boob has pretty much been my only sleep tool. She has been rocked to sleep probably a handful of times. When the cot was in my bedroom - I would put her down between 7-8, she would fall asleep easily whilst  nursing, then awake every 20-45 mins until around 10-11pm when she would finally have a 3hr stretch. This was between the ages of 3-7mo. 

Currently: On the advice of the HV, she suggested that maybe we were waking her in our room and to move her to her own bedroom. I did this before Xmas. She has not slept a single night in there - 20-30 mins max. I nurse her to sleep, place her in the cot, then after 20 mins she is awake and screaming. I could do this all night - its like after the first couple of times she doesn't let herself fall deeply into sleep aa she doesn't trust that we wont place her in the cot. Therefore, we move her into our bed. Where she can nurse all night. 

Last night, I decided to go in hard. I did bath - book - nurse - bed. I knew it was advisable to nurse at the start, but I didn't want to change up too much at bedtime (or maybe I should - I dont know?). She nursed to sleep, I placed her in the cot. She woke after the predicted 20 mins, then my partner managed to get her back to sleep. Again, she woke after a few mins. I have a camera, so I decided to watch her before going in. She was crying, but then she would sit up and look around the room for a little while, then cry again and so on. She did this for about half an hour before I decided to go in. As soon as she saw me, she absolutely screamed. Then it really went to shit and my partner brought her into the bedroom with me. 

I havent had an evening to myself in months. I cant have a bath or read a book because she is constantly attached to me. Naps are contact naps because she wakes after 20 mins in her cot, and will be overtired and miserable. My partner hasn't slept in the bed for weeks.

165,sleeptrain,"We start sleep training our 5 month old tomorrow! We are planning to use the ferber method and move our baby to her own room and crib. I am comfortable nursing her through the night as needed. My goal isn't to get her to sleep through the night without nursing. It's more to get her to sleep independently as I spend half my day bouncing her to sleep. She currently sleeps in a pack and play next to the bed, or on bed next to me (recent thing we started when she got a cold)

Two questions:

1. Do we need to do the ferber method each time I put her back in her crib?  Even in the middle of the night?
2. Is it detrimental if we are a little flexible in our approach? Our days are still not perfectly scheduled, so sometimes we start bedtime a little earlier or later.

Typical day- start time indicated:

Feed 1: 630-830
Nap 1: 9-1030- 45 mins - 1.5 hours
Feed 2: 10-1130
Nap 2: 1230-130 - 45 mins - 1 hour
Feed 3: 130-230
Nap 3: 430-520 - 30 - 45 mins
Final feed - 7-730
First round of night sleep- Starts from 730 - 9 
Night feed 1- 930 (dream feed)
Night feed 2- 12-2
Night feed 3- 4-6

Current Challenges:

As you can see every day is different so it's hard for me to schedule things.  When I nurse at night, sometimes she goes back to sleep immediately. Sometimes, she's up for over an hour of nursing, diaper changes, and bouncing. On occasion, she will have a full 1.5-hour wake window. It's exhausting. All our naps start out as contact naps. After the final feed, if she doesn't sleep right away at 730, she gets really fussy and cries until I bounce her to sleep. I live in Canada so have a 1 year maternity leave. I don't need her to be super scheduled

Our baby girl still nurses 2-4x / night unsure how much because I’m purely exhausted. We bought the PLS book read it in 36hours and tried implementing stuff last month: SWAP. 
Well this girl is strong and got so aggressive and angry when I would try and get some distance she’s strong willed and keeps trying. 
Now she’s extremely clingy and wants to touch my face and will reach her arms out in her sleep just to see if we are there. If not she rolls over and stands up in her crib squawking or laughing.

Yes we tried CIO/ modified ferber @5 month for a week and a half and she lost her voice couldn’t babble it gave me so much anxiety and she would turn purple and gasp and it was a horrible experience for us. We would go into her nursery and she would start crying from anxiety I guess? 

Schedule: we have tried to adjust bedtime wake times / naps etc 

Right now her bedtime is always shifty because of her naps (6:30-8) depending. if I have to wake up early she wakes up too because I’m not there. 
She eats every 3-4hrs but at night she’ll try to eat every 2 hrs while co sleeping.

Many nights, she wakes up completely at around midnight and doesn't sleep for an hour or more.

We started leaving her in a crib after 40 minutes of bedtime routine (soothing, reading, singing, rocking), checking on her every 5–10 minutes. 

The first night was horrible, she eventually vomited after 40 minutes of crying, we changed, and she fell asleep without nursing but in our bed. 
The second night was easier, she cried much less, fell asleep in the crib, but then vomited again (we fed earlier that evening). 
The next day she became extremely attached to me, freaking out every time I'll get up, or she thinks I'm leaving. A lot of crying and fussing over everything. It was impossible to put her down, even back to our bed.

181,sleeptrain,"So my baby has been a great sleeper since he was 3 months old. He literally slept through the night since then. We maybe had 5-6 „bad“ nights when he would wake up 1-2 times but just needed a bottle and went right back to sleep. 

For three days now, we would start our normal bedtime routine, he usually gets drowsy or falls asleep when drinking his bottle, then I would either carry him for 2-4 minutes or just put him down right away (which usually made him wake up or if he was still up, he falls asleep by himself.) Sometimes I would put him down fully awake and he would turn to his right and fall asleep. He sleeps in his own bed since day 1!  But recently, he falls asleep at the bottle, I put him down and he starts crying! We don‘t go in right away but by the time we go in, all sleep pressure is gone! He‘s wide awake and we have to take him out and he‘s up for another hour:

Typical schedule is:
Wake up 5 
First nap 8/8:30 (either 30 min cat nap or 1,5 hours if I feed him when he wakes up after 30 mins) 
Second nap is 2 hours after he woke up
Same for the third nap (best if third nap is from 4-5:30 but recently his last nap has been from 2:30-4ish)
Wake time before bed is only 1,5 or 2 hours.

Before anyone says that the wake time before bed is too short, please keep in mind that this has always worked for us. He usually sleeps 9-10 hour stretches over night. I feel like if I try to keep him up for too long he falls asleep and the bottle and cries when I put him down. He also shows a lot of tired cues after being up for 2 hours.

After 3 hours of trying to get him to sleep, he still sleeps through the night but getting him to sleep has become a real challenge.

Some recent changes we made:
- I‘ve stopped breastfeeding him in the morning and night and gave him only the bottle instead (he used to get both) and only bf to extend his naps next to me
- Sometimes if I‘m not in the mood to go on another 2 hour walk with him, I‘ll put him down in bed next to me and give him the bottle when he‘s already lying flat. This seems to easiest way for me to make him do a nap but I‘m not sure if it‘s a bad habit.

182,sleeptrain,"I just wanted to say thank you to this wonderful group! I’ve read many helpful post and comments over here that eventually helped me to sleep train my 6 month old. I also used ‘The Baby Sleep Solution’ book but I felt like I already knew everything while reading it thanks to you guys!
We started sleep training two nights ago. The first time our LO cried for 33 mins in total, I was checking in on her every 3/5/10 mins. Then in the middle of the night for 40 mins but not too bad and it was more like fussing with big pauses in between, and a little more closer to the morning. That’s all. The next morning her first nap was also in the crib for about an hour, two following naps where in the stroller. The second night it took her 7 mins to fall asleep without me entering the nursery (since she wasn’t crying, just fussing) and she slept up until 8am (from 7pm). I woke up once to dream feed her at 4 am just because I couldn’t sleep anymore lol. My body was shocked by all the sleep I had that night. Now she is sleeping for her first nap of the day for over an hour and I feel so blessed and happy.
I do want to say that over this two days I was the one who had severe separation anxiety. One thought about not having our contact naps anymore was really sad and painful for me. I was in tears for the whole two days because of this. It felt so lonely. I couldn’t believe that my baby is growing so fast. However, this morning once I saw how rested and happy my baby is I realized that it’s all for good!
Some background: our LO was EBF from birth and she doesn’t take a bottle (mostly because there’s no need for it now). Her night time sleep has always been in the crib, but it gradually shifter from big 4-5 hours stretches to waking up every 40 mins for comfort nursing. During the day, however, she hasn’t slept in her crib or somewhere else besides my arms a single time. All her day time naps were in my arms with my nip in her mouth, so I was a human pacifier for quite a while.
Honestly, I didn’t believe that with such attachment to me it will be so easy to sleep train our LO. Now instead of bonding during contact naps we will spend more time playing and interacting with happy and well-rested mom 😊",Appreciation Post,1672948600.0

I have an 18 month old daughter, and she had a really difficult birth injury/meconium aspiration/NICU stay that took her a really long time to recover from (she is still using night time oxygen, after several months on daytime oxygen support). She is doing SO well health-wise and will discontinue night time oxygen in April, making a full recovery. 

With her difficult first year, we did absolutely zero sleep training as we were just in survival mode, and kept her in a crib next to my side of the bed. 100% contact naps until about a month ago, when we started putting her down (with some success!), and we do still hold her when she wakes up after a short nap. (I realize this probably has to stop, lol)

For the past month or so, she has started waking up 5+ times per night and demanding ""mama,"" and to be held to return to a deep sleep before being placed back in her crib. I realized it was a battle of the wills, made a pediatrician appt to ask for advice, and she recommended putting her in her own room and trying Ferber.

184,sleeptrain,"I recently came to this subreddit as I was being pressured by the in laws to sleep train our 5m and drop night feeds. You all reassured me he was totally normal as he was putting himself to sleep for naps (I feed to sleep at night as I selfishly enjoy it) and only waking up twice a night for a week.

However, he’s said HOLD MY MILK and has started waking up every 3 hours on the dot screaming, even though he’s not a crier normally. He’s so irate that he can’t even feed for a good 10 mins of crying, which is completely unlike him.

Currently, he wakes up at 7.30am and has wake windows of roughly 2 hours from then, but naps are only 30-45mins long. I’ve tried extending the nap with feeding or contact nap but it makes no difference. Bedtime is roughly 7.30pm and usually he’s fed to sleep, but the last two nights he’s fed then been put down awake still and falls asleep within 10mins. He would usually wake up around 12am and 4am for a feed and goes straight back down with no issue.

Is the crying a developmental thing? Wonder Weeks app has informed me we’ve entered into leap 5, could this be the reason? Or does our schedule need amending to help assist longer periods of sleep at night?

186,sleeptrain,"Hello!




As the title states, tl;dr is that our child consistently wakes up in the middle of the night - we've been bringing him to our bed, but I am trying to sleeptrain again so that he would sleep through the night in his crib. 




Our 15 month old was sleep trained when he was around 6 months. We've had our ups and downs but we've had long stretches when he would sleep through the night - it was glorious! 




Around 3 months back - he would wake up and cry in the middle of the night, anytime between 11 PM - 2 AM. We were travelling, and we brought him to our bed and slept together for the remainder of the night. Then he got sick, then he was teething, then we were travelling again... so we've been going through this routine of peaceful bedtime routine - cries during the night - bring to bed - shuffle a little to fall back asleep in our bed - wake up in the morning. 





His bedtime is effortless and is pretty solid. He goes down within 10 minutes after our bedtime routine during the set window of his bedtime (630 -700 PM). I have tried the following to re-sleep train so that he would fall back asleep in his crib:
* nightlight - I placed a dim red light (hatch). We started during nap time so that it wasn't a complete new element in the room. He cried hysterically at bedtime when we left the room until it was turned off... we haven't tried it since. 
* cry it out - our original sleep training method was extinction method. Now that he's older... it's been a little tougher for us to do this, and after 20-30 minutes of hard crying, we end up bringing him back to our room. 
* gentler sleep training - after reading through u/cycleman and other posters' threads... once he starts crying, I wait 15 minutes to see if he'll settle (by this time he's standing and hard crying) - I go in and pick him up, rock him until he's calm and falling asleep on me - I try to put him back into the crib, at which point he senses and starts getting upset - when his body hits the crib he hard cries again - I kiss & leave and wait 15 minutes - rock to calm - put down in the crib - hard cries, wait 15 minutes - rock to calm - put down in the crib - pat to sleep, which takes a long while... 





My question here are as follows:


* Have anyone kept the routine of: bedtime routine and the child sleeping independently, and then co-sleeping when the child wakes up in the middle of the night? How did this go for you?
* Has this gentle training method (or variations of it) worked for others - as a working mom, I spend so many hours with my child each day, and having him cry so hard has been getting harder and harder, especially as he is getting more words and more aware of his surroundings :/




Main driver in wanting to sleep train him is because 1) when he comes into our bed, sometimes it takes a while for him to re-settle, which keeps me up 2) I worry that his night wakings will somehow inch closer and closer to bedtime and his bedtime routine will be undone 3) shouldn't sleeping through the night be better than interrupted sleep during which you change where you sleep?





Much confused - any insight would be appreciated!!





p.s. - In terms of his schedule - he wakes up around 530 AM, naps at his daycare around 12 PM for about an hour to two hours, bedtime around 630 PM. On the weekends, he naps a little earlier around 11 AM - and when we follow his queues for sleep during the day, he would nap twice, but usually totaling around 2 hours.",Retraining 15 month for night wakings & questions on co-sleep,1672947171.0

Of course she didn't! Anyways, I've had a talk with them since and they will bump her to the top of the diaper changing line. That day, she didn't eat or drink anything at daycare.

I have a newborn son. He’s my first. He just turned 2 months old. I’m exclusively breastfeeding.

He used to sleep all day and stay up all night. We finally got into the routine of him sleeping at night, and being up during the day with naps here and there. Now he stays up all day NO naps. He sleeps from like 8pm to 9am (in intervals) He’ll sleep for like 4 hours and wake to eat for an hour or so, then back to sleep for 3 hours and so on.
So he’s only getting like 10 hours of sleep a day max… 
Everything I read says newborns should be sleeping 14-18 hours a day. Naps throughout the day. 

I don’t know if I’m over worrying or if there’s a problem :/ 
He will fall asleep at the breast, but as soon as my boob is out of his mouth or I lay him down he’s up crying.
He also goes to bed by breastfeeding.
I just haven’t found another way without not sleeping at all. 
I’ve tried the pacifier and it’s a work in progress. Not quite there yet.

Any experience / knowledge would be helpful. Is this just a phase? Will it get easier? Do I need to struggle through trying to get him to figure out sleeping on his own? Do I need to be patient ? 

I don’t want him to rely 100% on boob and mess him up being able to cope / self sooth / sleep on his own.

192,sleeptrain,"Baby is almost 12 months old. It became apparent over the holidays that she will no longer nap or sleep overnight anywhere but home. When home she is put in her crib awake and falls asleep herself within about 15 minutes, no crying, sleeps through the night (same for naps)

For naps away we used the same method as always, but she screams bloody murder when trying to put her down. We resorted to contact napping when away but she would still wake up every half hour in alarm before realizing someone was beside her and resettling.

We usually let the grandparents have her once or twice a month but are unsure what to do since she’s refusing sleep there. They are firm believers in full CIO which makes me a little uncomfortable because at home baby is asleep with absolutely no crying.

I’m assuming this is likely due to separation anxiety but even when I’m there she doesn’t sleep well so I feel guilty leaving her there to cry. Should I just let them have her CIO?

After waking up from this phase he requires pacifier to be put back over and over, otherwise he cries alot and fully wakes up.

Here goes:

We just recently transitioned our 5mo from SNOO to her crib. She is down to 3 naps a day, though the nap lengths have been all over the place. Recently, they have been very short 35-45 mins (have been this way since about 3.5 mos, honestly). Her wake windows vary, but are mostly in the 2 hour range, with her last WW being the longest at 2.5 hours. Daytime naps usually total 2.75 - 3.25 hours. Schedule looks something like this:

7:30am - Wake

9:30am - First nap (35-45min)

Then - 1.5/2 hr WWs depending on prior nap length until about 4:30pm

4:30pm - 7pm - Feed/playtime

7:30pm - Bedtime

8:15pm - Wake up crying/screaming uncontrollably

8:15-9:15pm - Soothe baby multiple times until finally...

9:30pm - Falls asleep until about 3am

The only part that feels consistent about her schedule is her first wake time, which is almost always 7:30am (however, we do usually wake around 6am for a nursing session, but she falls back to sleep afterwards). Everything else feels completely random - I try my best to read her cues and have experimented with both earlier and later bedtimes, but the naps stay consistently short and the 45 min false start at bedtime has only been getting worse.

198,sleeptrain,"I’d gotten great advice from this sub (lurking and posting!) ahead of STing my LO and wanted to give an update/ask a few random questions. Thanks in advance for reading this incredibly long post!

Last night was Night 4 of STing my 5.5 month old. We’re using the “happy sleeper” method and it’s going well!

Bedtime is 7:30 with a DWT of 6:30 (would I like 7:30-7? Yes, but I know she can probably only manage 11 😅). Routine is nursing (finished 30 minutes before bedtime),diaper/pjs, some quiet play upstairs in her room, sleep sack, books, listen to one song together and bed. I added a few things to our old routine (quiet play and song) based on the recommendations in the Happy Sleeper but also because of how Night 2 went…

Night 1: LO put herself down, which has happened a handful of times in the past. She woke up about 1.5 hours later UPSET. Cried on and off for ~50 minutes but only needed 2 checks (I.e., only two periods of crying lasting 5 minutes). Slept 10-11:45pm, husband fed her a bottle but she only ate ~2.5 ounces and conked back out. Back up at 4am. Nursed her and she went right back down. Awake a little before 6:30 and quietly babbling. I went in and woke her up at 6:30am.

Night 2: Started getting fussy before her last nursing session, which is very unlike her (we never had the witching hour even as a newborn) so I nursed her and the fussiness and crying continued through bedtime routine. Cried on and off for 40 minutes with 2 checks but only because she flipped herself to belly and couldn’t get back over and was upset. Awake at 9 and cried for ~15 minutes but not continuously. Slept til 1:45am, husband gave a bottle. Back up at 3:30am and she probably didn’t need to eat but her cry was very sad so I fed her. Up at 6:30.

Night 3: Fussiness and crying started a full hour before bedtime. At that point I added some quiet play but she was still so upset that I turned down even the dim lights and we rocked (oops! Usually bounce on the yoga ball so did not think about rocking as a sleep association) and listened to a song. Her eyes got very heavy and I put her down and she was out like a light. Awake 45 minutes later, of course. Cried for ~30 minutes and kept flipping herself onto her stomach until I finally said “ok you can stay like that” even though her arm was flung out and it did not look comfortable AT ALL. But she fell asleep and stayed asleep until 3am!! I couldn’t believe it. Nursed her and put her back to bed. She was awake a little before DWT but I left her in crib until 6:30.

Night 4: No fussing or crying before bedtime thankfully. Put herself down with no crying in about 5 minutes. Slept til 2 and I nursed her and put her back awake. She fussed a bit but fell back asleep. Woke up at 5:15 and was happily babbling so I just let her be, hoping she’d fall back asleep. At about 5:45 she started fussing and crying and I know CIO isn’t typically successful for EMWs so I went in, kept the lights off, nursed her, popped paci in and put her down. She fussed for a bit but then fell asleep and I woke her up at 6:40 just to give her a little extra sleep. 

Her schedule during ST has been 2/2.25-2.5/2.25-2.5/2.75. She’s a chronic cat napper and I wanted to make sure she got ~3 hours of day sleep during ST so we’ve been doing first nap in the crib (30 minutes - would love for this to be extended but my husband isn’t as fastidious as I am about all this. Also a SAHM dad so I get it, he wants some baby free time), stroller nap (~1.5 hours), and third nap has been contact because unfortunately no capping is necessary and I always need to extend to get to correct WW for bedtime. Prior to ST I did a few nights of a 3 hour WW before bed but, per this sub’s helpful advice, it seemed like her wake pattern (every 3 hours) indicated that might have been too long. At 2.75 I see some yawns and eye glassine’s right before I put her down. 

Questions:

- Could today’s EMW be bc she actually needs less sleep overnight? Thinking no bc nursing knocked her back out? Is it possible I now need to stretch her last WW since she’s more caught up on sleep and getting close to 3 hours when we were maxxing out at 2.5 previously (due to a 12 hour night that was only that long bc of frequent wake ups).

-Was my response to today’s EMW reasonable or should I have tried a snooze button bed feed when she woke up at 5:15 just so she didn’t lose that hour of sleep up front? 

-She was also VERY fussy less than 2 hours after her wake up (unusual) so I rocked her to sleep and tried a contact nap to get her first nap to be a bit longer. She fought against connecting sleep cycles even with a ton of rocking and I had to give in and let her wake up after ~40 minutes. I know that nap 1 is supposed to be the first to lengthen but maybe she’s just not ready OR she wants a short first nap? OR she’s just not into contact napping? Not really sure but even on stroller walks her first nap often maxes out at 45 minutes. I don’t really expect her day sleep to improve for a bit since she’s not even 6 months but would be good to know if anyone has experience with babies who prefer a short first nap!",5.5 month old sleep training questions,1672934666.0

She gets super sleepy before the end of each wake window. She tries to fall asleep when I nurse her during the wake times and when she has her bottle 30 mins before bedtime. Are their any other suggestions for fixing split nights? I hate the thought of her just lying awake for hours every night and it’s making her more tired during the day.

Edit: Adding to say she didn’t have this problem before she was sleep trained around 3 weeks ago. Her naps to used to be only 30 mins each (4 naps) and she had false starts at bedtime. But after the false starts she slept until 4-5am feeding without waking up.",5mo Split Nights Help,1672934045.0
200,sleeptrain,"Working on sleep training my 4mo babe, she’s been showing signs of being able to self soothe so I decided it was time to start. Sleep has been a constant struggle with her, it usually has taken me hours each day and night of shushing, bouncing, swaddling, nursing, multiple sound machines, complete darkness, you name it….all to get a nap of about 35 minutes. It seemed ridiculous that it should take all of that every single time and was becoming unrealistic. 

The first nap of the day is usually the easiest. I figured out I need to shorten the wake window a bit to get her down quickly, and today I actually went a little late on starting the nap. BUT, I set her down in her crib with her rain noises, her Zipadee Zip, and her baby einstein’s ocean crib soother with the lights and music, just thinking it would relax her while I took a minute to finish my coffee….and she got quiet. I peeked through the crack in the door and saw her eyes fluttering. I watched her go to sleep. Right before the lights on the soother turned off, she closed her eyes for good. I didn’t have to nurse, rock, bounce, shush, nothing!!! Within 15 minutes she was down all on her own! 

I’m sure the rest of the naps won’t be as easy…but this is an excellent start and I’m so proud of my babe for learning so quickly. If even just one nap is easy, I’ll take it!",A small win this morning 🥹,1672933945.0

202,sleeptrain,"My previously sleep trained 25 month old has been having some serious sleep regressions, likely brought on by potty training, which she's now mastered. Any advice to get her back on a better schedule?

She gets about 10-10.5 hours of sleep overnight, and a 1.5-2 hour nap about 7 hours after waking. I know this is a long gap, but it's our daycare provider's rigid schedule, and LO has been pretty ok with it for most of the past year. Getting her to go to sleep is a little drawn out, but our problem is primarily with new night wakings. We would prefer not to push bedtime back, because if she slept later we wouldn't be able to get her to daycare on time.

LO is routinely, and newly, waking sometime between 12:30-1:30 am, asking for milk and to be held/read to, for us to tell stories, etc. It takes at least 30 minutes to get her back down, sometimes more like 60-75 minutes.

We usually accommodate the milk (which used to be a rare request), hold her in the chair for some amount of time, and sit next to her in bed for some amount of time; and leave while she's awake. If she's very worked up we will go through the entire bedtime routine with her again (milk, books, tucking in, stories, kiss goodnight). If we just tell her it's night time and go back to sleep she wails. Often she'll cry for us again 30-60 minutes after we leave the room. I made a huge mistake of pulling a mattress in and just sleeping in there the other week, which settled her down immediately, and now obviously she wants me to sleep next to her.

Routine:

* 6:45 am wake (anytime 6:15-7 am)
* 2-4 pm nap (daycare provider's schedule)
* 7:00 pm bedtime routine starts
* 8:00 pm fast asleep at/before this time

Edit to add: Her regular bedtime routine does not usually involve crying/wailing when we leave the room. This is only during her night wakings. She has blackout curtains, white noise, a nightlight, and a time-to-wake clock (which she understands).",Advice on 2 year regression,1672933779.0

She even gave us a couple of nights where she slept for 8+ hours, it was glorious. Well for the past 4 nights, she has been waking every few hours, sometimes hourly. I'll usually feed her the first time since that's the longest stretch but every time after that I let her cry for a few minutes to see if she goes back to sleep.

He is now 5mo and started daycare this week. It’s been AWFUL is the least I could say. We’ve been doing half days so far to help him adjust but he’s been crying a lot and his teachers won’t even bat an eye(they have cameras and I’ve been watching him through the day). While the rest of the kids get to play with toys and tummy time all in one area, my baby is being placed in the mamaroo or bouncer for 85% of the time he’s there. 

No toys are being given to him and there’s very little interaction between him and the rest of the kids. 

He’s regressed on his ST and has been getting up at nights crying. His daytime naps have been trickier as he doesn’t want to put himself to sleep when he’s at home. When he’s at the daycare, he just cries in the crib and once in a while someone will give him his pacifier. 

ST aside, I feel ABSOLUTELY devastated the way he is being treated. I understand there’s multiple kids and their attention cannot be on him 24/7 but seeing how they’re isolating my child and just strapping him to a swing while he just sits there and cries is beyond heartbreaking. 

Im not sure where to go from here— we’ve been a little bit lenient with ST rules in the house bc I know he needs some extra love and cuddles but man I am at my wits end and have been contemplating removing him from daycare, quitting my job, and becoming a SAHM.

She is breastfed and currently cosleeping because she is waking up literally every single hour during the night. There is no long first stretch. It is every 1-1.5 hours from 7pm to 7am. She wakes up looking for the boob. She will settle for being bounced on a yoga ball most of the time as well but then transfer can be tricky.

211,sleeptrain,"Hi all!  Long-time lurker,  first-time poster. I'm here to ask an advice, suggestions or maybe just for a calm word. We're raising an 8.5-month-old baby girl. About one month ago we sleep trained her. We used modified Ferber, where I stayed in the room and comfort her. Things went quite well and she would fall asleep by herself after some fussing (max 10min) both for night sleep and naps. Sometimes she even would give me a smile when I put her into the crib.   


Two weeks ago we needed to travel to another city where we stay for one month. I was prepared for a tough couple of days, but actually, she got used to the new place very quickly. OR at least we thought so... After a few days, the crying before the sleep started to intensify. At the same time, there was one day when she fall asleep nursing in the morning and one day when she got less sleep because her diaper leaked she got so frustrated and angry she didn't know how to calm herself, so we went outside and let her sleep in her stroller. Fast forward to today, she starts to cry exactly the same second I put her into the crib. Yesterday she already started protesting when we enter her room. The screaming before every sleep is now 5/5. Though the morning wake-ups are getting early too. The naps had shortened.  On the positive side - at least crying before sleep not getting longer than 10mins.   


I thought maybe it is a schedule issue. We shuffled the times a little bit. Didn't help. I believe the problem is still in our schedule or in our routine. So here it comes.  


Wake up at about 6:15 am. (It used to be 7 am, but now every morning it's getting earlier.)  
Play around for a few minutes, change a diaper and nurse.   
Activity time.   
Solids after about 1h 40 min from the awakening. It usually takes about 15 to 25min.  
After breakfast, my wife breastfed her one more time. It takes about 10min.   
The plan after nursing is to play around for half an hour, but pretty much always this feed happens too late and we start our nap routine after something like 10 mins. (Problem?)  
The nap routine consists of putting the baby into a sleepbag, saying goodbye to the curtains, smiling to the little girl in the mirror, and going from our bedroom to the corridor where my wife sings her a song.  She used to don't give a shit that we were putting her into the sleepbag, but now she always gets grumpy.  Then I pick our baby, we say goodbye to Mommy and I take her to her room. My wife can't listen to our daughter screaming that's why at least for now I'm the one who does all the heavy stuff. I work from home so it's not a big deal for me.   


So I put her down on her back. I used to just leave her there alone and she would fall asleep in a couple of minutes. But now she turns on her belly, crawls to the side of the bed where she can see the door to her room, and starts screaming. I've tried to stay in the room to comfort her, but it didn't make any significant difference.   


After she wakes up - the schedule is very similar. Nurse, play, solids, play or nurse depending on time. The nap routine is the same as well.   


Naps used to be about 1h 20 min. Now they are down to \~1h .  That's why bedtime is getting early as well because we're still going by the wake windows. The bedtime routine starts 40min before sleep. Breastfeed, bath, PJ's, sleepbag, all the goodbyes, song from mommy and I put her down to her crib.   
Same hard protests as before the naps. 

  
She still eats twice per night, but we thought will do night weaning later on when we fix the sleep. 

The wake windows are 3/3/4. Although today I put her for the first nap after 2.5h she screamed for exactly 10mins but then slept for 1h 24min. Maybe it's something worth considering?   


In general, she is an amazing, healthy cutie pie, and seems happy most of the time. But the screaming is killing us. We knew that there will be some at the beginning of the sleep training, but now it's getting hard to manage. We literally fear bedtime.   


Any ideas about what we could change? Or maybe it's just a temporary separation anxiety and it will go away? How we could get back to our desired 7:30 bedtime?

Second problem. Sleep. Atm if this also isn’t contact it’s bouts of 1-2 hour blocks, before he gets really unsettled around 3am and contact is only way he will sleep. It’s been really hard. Lots of sleep associations, but we’re doing what we can to get him down. Quite broken. He falls asleep in the cot, but with me over him and tapping him and singing. 

Third problem. Night weaning. A couple of feeds after midnight that he doesn’t really need, but screams for them and we’re desperate for him to fall back.

222,sleeptrain,"Just in case anyone needs suggestions for the dreaded crap naps. 

My 13 mos old has always been a horrible napper. Might be because we let him fall asleep on us at 6 mos and again at 9 mos so he lost the ability to self soothe. Anyway his naps were typically 20-30 mins tops. Basically when his REM was over he would wake up, stand up, bounce and whine. My husband works from home and his office is next door so letting him cry out during the day isn't an option. 

On the other hand my baby is a GREAT night time sleeper. He sleeps around 12 hrs through the night without waking up. One of the big differences between night sleeping and naps is how dark it is. So I did an overhaul on the black out curtains (clipping them together, blocking the bottom, sides, and top, etc.). I also switched him to 1 nap/day at 12pm right after lunch. He is now napping 1.5-2 hrs. I feel like I have my life back. Sometimes I would spend almost an hour trying to get him to sleep for him only to wake up 20 mins later. And I would do this 2x/day. 

In summary, try making the room as dark as possible for daytime naps and switch to 1 nap/day (if ready) after a meal.

He’s always been a great dad, but lately we have bumped heads on almost every baby related topic we’ve come across. Normally we see eye to eye with our parenting styles, without issues, so I’ve been really frustrated lately.

He wants to go full on cry it out method with our son to the point that he doesn’t even want to give him his pacifier more than three times if he’s spitting it out. I understand his frustrations but if we’re not picking him up or soothing him besides providing the pacifier, are we really doing that much damage to his development? 

Am I being the overprotective first time mom? 

It hurts to hear him cry so much- but I refrain from picking him up and settle on giving him the pacifier and walking away.

I'll try to keep it short. We're not sure what to do.

We started CIO 4-5 weeks ago at 6.5mo. Baby cried about 30mn the first night, 15 the second, until it was almost nothing.

Last week, we'd put him to bed, he'd fuss for 30s - 2mn, then sleep for the whole night. It was perfect.

However, he's been in pain these last few days because his top teeth are coming out. Here's how it went yesterday:

- Put him to bed at his normal time, 7pm.
- Cried for 15-20mn before falling asleep.
- Woke up multiple times between 7 and 10pm while we were downstairs. Cried 5-15mn each time.
- Cried 15-30mn when we got up to bed around 10pm.
- Woke up crying multiple times between 10pm and 1 am. 
- We decided to exceptionally bring him to our bed at 1 am, after about 45mn of non stop crying (after checking diaper, temperature, and giving Tylenol)
- After that he was still waking up multiple times, but breasted and crying less.

Today, we put him to bed 2 hours ago, at 7 as usual, and the way it's going, it seems like the night is going to be similar to yesterday.

We now feed her in the nursery, then bath, then PJs and bed. She sleeps well generally, goes to sleep in the crib fully awake at night time and for naps, and just has one feed during the night.

However, sometimes I've noticed that she gets fussy before the end of her bedtime feed and doesn't finish it. She'll start ok, then rub her eyes, knock the bottle out of her mouth etc and start to refuse it. We used to give her a bit of time to try again but then if not we'd just move onto bath time. Recently though, when she was sick and off her milk, a few times I tried just giving her the bottle again right before putting her down, when she was bathed and in her sleep sack - just because it was more important to me to get something in her. I noticed that she'd be much calmer and more willing to finish the bottle at this point. I've actually done this again the past few nights, even though she's now better. So we start the feed before her bath, but if she doesn't finish it I try again right before bed and she'll happily have the rest of it.

However, we’ve been running into some night sleep issues that I simply can’t figure out how to troubleshoot. I’m not sure if we are in the 4 month regression or if that’s still to come… but either way, we are open to any and all feedback about how to get night sleep back on track.

- Baby is formula fed, eating about 25-30 oz a day
- Our current wake windows are usually 1.75/2/2/2/2
- Baby is taking 4 naps, with the last nap capped at 30 mins and at least a two hour wake window before bed.
- Naps total about 4 hours a day. Nighttime sleep totals about 10-11 hours a day. 
- He sleeps a consistent 90 minute nap if contact napping or in the car, otherwise we are lucky if we get a 40 minute nap in the crib.
- Bedtime usually 7:30 or 8 pm. 

Between 8 to 12 weeks old, we were following the Moms of Call schedule, and we were having pretty consistent naps and baby would sleep from about 7:30 pm to 6 am with one 2 am feed. Lovely!

From 12-15 weeks ish, he was sleeping from 7:30 pm - 6 am with no MOTN wakeups.  Even better!

For the last couple of weeks, he will sleep from 8 pm until somewhere between 2-4 am, but once he has that first MOTN wake up, it’s game over. He’s up at least every hour after that. It’ll go something like this:
- he’ll wake up at 3 am.
- We wait usually about 20 mins to see if he falls back asleep. He almost never does. Once he starts getting loud, we go in, pick him up, and rock him back to sleep.
- We transfer him back to the crib once he’s fully asleep. 
- He sleeps for 20-40 more minutes.
- Cycle, rinse, and repeat. 
- Moms on Call says we have to wait to feed him until the “desired wake time” of 7 am, but he simply will not sleep that long. This usually results in one of us contact napping from 6-7 am to get him to sleep until that first bottle. Is this bullshit?
- We’ve had maybe 2-3 times in the last few weeks when he has slept the entire 10 hours, but it was when we were traveling or during the holidays when the stimulation was a lot higher. 

Questions we have:
- Is this the 4 month regression?
- it seems unrealistic that he can last til 7 am. Should we just give him that first bottle and start the day at 6?
- I’m fine with anything that needs to happen during the day to get back to a normal sleep at night (meaning sleeping until 6 am). If that’s reducing naps, fine. If that’s contact napping, cool. If that’s changing bed time, no problem. I took an extended leave from work, so I don’t care what my days look like as long as I can get this baby to not wake up a million times during the night. Should naps or wake windows change?
- Do we start sleep training now?

I’m positive he’s not waking because he’s hungry. He falls asleep again pretty quickly once we pick him up. Perhaps this is our problem here. He also doesn’t really cry. When he wakes up in the night, it’s kinda like he’s just saying “hello?! I’m awake! You can come get me now!” so that throws us off a bit. Even the few times we’ve fed him in the middle of the night to see if that helped, he still doesn’t sleep longer than an hour. He’s a very amicable and chill baby who adjusts quickly, so suggestions are welcome.

Over the past few weeks he's had a bad cold/cough and woke up congested between 1 and 3 am. Would not go back to sleep on his own and needed to be rocked. And still wakes up at 5 am.

This week he is over the cold but he wakes up at 2-3 am, takes 1-2 hours to put down and still wakes at 5. He takes 2 naps at daycare. They used to be about 1 hour each. Now it is more like 30-45 mins. 

For context, we live in a small apartment so he doesn't have his own room. His dad snores and coughs loudly. And we can't move, the city is in a rent crisis. I could temporarily move his crib to the living room. But that's not going to work long term as my SO uses it when he comes home from work.

My little one is 9 weeks old. 

I am having trouble getting my little one to nap during the day.

If I don't put him in the sling he barely sleeps and if he does sleep in his bed he doesn't sleep long.

Only in the sling can he sleep for long periods of time.

If he does not sleep in the sling, I can put him to bed and he wakes up after 10 - 30 minutes then he wants to bottle again although I know in the sling he would have slept and not yet been hungry.

I don't have a routine, I recognize the tired signs either too late or way too early I try to get him to sleep.

I try to get him to sleep mist of the time after 1 - 11/2 hours awake. But if then it takes forever. I Rock, sing, eventually fed again. Till he sleeps at some point. And the time after feds are always different. Sometimes I try tummy time, often he just is with me in the kitchen and watching me cleaning. Maybe he needs more playtime. But if I do, it seems that it's too mcib for him?

We had some overnight sleep issues with her between 6.5-7.5 months that we solved with night weaning and a bit more sleep training, but are now in a scenario where she is fighting all naps harrrd. Night sleep seems unaffected, although she’s waking up a bit earlier than she used to (6:15 vs 6:45).

We have had a firm nap routine established for months (feeding at least 30 mins before, stories etc).

259,sleeptrain,"A few months ago I posted on this sub about my son and I was desperately trying to understand how to help him sleep more consistently for his own benefit. We had done Ferber for naps and bedtime but still he wasn’t having consistent naps and had regular MOTN wakes (which I knew were out of habit).

A number of absolute angels on this sub gave me so many ideas of how to help him and it only felt like right to share what actually worked!:

1. Amending bedtime routine - we now do boob > bath/book > change > bed. The move of his feed to the start of bedtime now gives him about 20 minutes before he goes down for the night. I do sometimes miss feeding him to sleep but this was a game changer. I’ve recommended to so many people to start with this. 

2. Moving him to his own room - we moved house on 20/12 and he went into his own room straight away. I was worried that he wouldn’t be able to sleep with us, or a million different things. Unsurprisingly it was me who worried excessively and he was a dream 😂

3. Solids - when I finally got into a good routine with food, doing lunch and dinner (alongside full milk feeds) I realised how he was still hungry through the night. Now he’s getting enough calories during the day, he has no need to wake. 

4. Wake windows/routine - I finally nailed his routine, he’s on 2/2.5/2.5/3 and understanding that he needed a total of 10 hours awake really made me understand the impact of sleep pressure on a baby. 

The day he turned 7 months, on NYE my boy slept through the night and has done so every single night since.

He still wakes up overnight, usually 2-3 times. He nurses, and goes right back to sleep. 

I wanted to start weaning off bottles, and getting him to eat more solids, but today he was given 3 bottles in order to initiate naps; he wouldn't even drink the milk out of a sippy cup. When I'm around, I'm just a human pacifier.

He briefly used a pacifier, and then sucked his thumb for a bit, but now rejects both of those. 

I'm planning to get him a floor bed and slowly transition him, but he's not quite old enough yet. But I really got myself in a pickle with the feed/sleep association, and I don't know how to fix it.

278,sleeptrain,"LO is 4 months old and we've been struggling with false starts for what seems like forever. Currently she is doing 7-7:30 wake up, 1/2/2/3 (we notice she does better through the day with a really short first wake window). Bedtime routine (boob, bath, book, bed with song) starts at 6:30 and bed by 7. We've been putting her down awake and some light belly pats and a paci and she falls asleep seemingly with no problem. After 30 mins she is up and screaming until i cave and put her in bed with me, after about 45 mins i can slide her over to her bedside bassinet (yes, it does feel like I'm making her sleep associations worse). She does 2 MOTN feeds around 1 and 4am, sleeps well in between with no issues going back down. She has her 4 month shots tomorrow, so we're planning to do FIO once she's feeling better. If that doesn't work after about a week, we will probably try graduated extinction because i am so tired of going to bed at 7:30pm and i just want an hour to myself to eat ice cream and watch a show. 

Here are my questions:
1. Will FIO work for the false starts? Do we just start a 15 minute timer from when she starts crying?
2. Are the false starts a symptom of something else? She really doesn't seem overtired to me and we've tried more naps, less naps, micro naps before bedtime, it feels like no matter what we do we get the same result.
3. How necessary is it to ditch the paci at the same time as sleep training? She doesn't typically wake up when it falls out, and i like the idea that it's easier to wean a paci than a thumb. Do i just need to get over it and take away her paci?

280,sleeptrain,"HELP. My 7 month old will not nap alone more than 35 minutes before full on screaming. I’ve researched and tried just about everything and am pretty exasperated.


CURRENT INFO:

-Nights are usually great. She goes down independently and sleeps 11-11.5 hours (trained at 5mos. by TCB/Ferber, then extinction). WWs are 2.75/3.25/3.5.

-Nap 1 we try independent because she puts herself to sleep easily in her crib. She wakes/screams (yes, screams) 16-33 minutes in each time. I give her 5-10 to settle (she never does) and then rescue with contact. Nap 2 is full contact.

-We have been on 2 naps for 3 weeks now. We had the same short nap/screaming issue on a 3 nap schedule with shorter WWs. I couldn’t fit her expanding WWs and 3 naps in anymore. The transition went shockingly smoothly.

-Average nap time totals 2.5-2.75 hours most days. (13.5-14.5 hours total sleep in a day)


HISTORY/ENVIRONMENT:

-For her whole life, she would only contact nap. I’d have to bounce her on a yoga ball to sleep, move to a rocker, then back to the ball to connect sleep cycles (and often she’d wake anyways after 30-40 minutes). Now she stays asleep consistently, but still needs help from me to connect cycles (usually bouncing or walking around in the dark room we’re in).

-At 5.75 mos, still on 3 naps, I did crib hour for naps 1 and 2. She learned to put herself to sleep through this, but only had a few unexplained longer naps. Most of the time she would wake early and scream 25+ min. until the hour was up. After 2.5 weeks of crib hour, I decided it didn’t seem fair to leave her cry when she was showing no progress extending naps. (Did I give up too soon?) So now we’re at “crib hour light” with a rescue, for nap 1 only, as mentioned above. 

-I experimented with WWs at this time (she was on 2/2.5/2.5/2.75) shortening and lengthening, and nothing changed. 

-We have a great 10-minute nap routine. Her room is very dark with white noise. Her last feed is 40-50 minutes before nap time. She is not waking from hunger. Temperature is fine, and she loves her sleep sack at night. No correlation with teething pain.

I will lose my mind if I continue contact naps with no end in sight. Plus I need to get things done. But I don’t know how to get her to connect cycles. Everything I’ve read says babies just do this by 5-6 months assuming they can fall asleep independently, but here I am with a 7mo who can put herself to sleep but not stay asleep. What do I do? 


IDEAS: 

-Continue as is with rescues after 5 minutes, hoping that when she’s ready she’ll connect cycles for nap 1, and then I can tackle nap 2 (frankly I don’t know if I can do this indefinitely though). 

-Restart crib hour—if I do, should I do crib 75 or 90 so we make it to the end of the day on 2 naps? For nap 1 only until she gets it, or both? When do you “give up” on an approach like crib hour and decide it’s not working? 

-Wait for crib hour until she’s really adjusted to a 2 nap schedule and WWs are a little longer

My son was sleeping thru the night until he hit the 4 month regression. He never really bounced back from it between teething and additional regressions down the line. He is now 10 months and is clingier than ever. I cannot get him to go down independently. He barely naps in his crib. CIO is hard because our apartment is VERY small (im talking basically a studio). He won’t even give me the opportunity to pat his back to sleep before crying. 

He has to nurse to sleep and naps. Most naps are me sidelying in the bed, then sneaking away and just keeping him in view (again, small apt. Can’t go far). Many nights spent the same. He wakes at minimum twice nightly to nurse and I think it’s for a full feed not comfort because I feel the letdown. 

He has started solids and is eating three meals a day. I haven’t truly started incorporating snacks so maybe he just isn’t full enough from the day time?

Does anyone have non-CIO methods or success stories? How did you move away from the nurse/sleep association? He doesn’t like pacifiers and has no attachments to any lovey, etc. just me🫠 please help.

Edited to add: I originally had a 7pm bedtime but had a lot of false starts. Moved it to 8ish PM. Today is day 2 of that. - naps are not routine because he won’t exceed 30 mins in his crib.

282,sleeptrain,"Thank you in advance for any help you can give!

Background: Baby is 5 months old. At 8 weeks, we did FIO, since then she goes down awake for all naps and overnight sleeps, puts herself to sleep in 5-10 minutes, minimal crying (< 1 minute). We separate feeds at least 20 min from bedtime. From 8wks to 3.5 mos, she was doing bed at 7pm, wakes/feeds at midnight and 4am. At 3.5 mo, she regressed, had wakes/feeds at 9pm, midnight, 4am.

Our Schedule: Wake up 6-7am. Weekend wake windows: 1.5/1.5/2/2/3. Weekdays (at daycare): 2/3/5. Daytime sleep: 2.5 - 4 hours.

10 days ago, we started CIO/PLS. We put her down awake at 7pm. We won't feed nor comfort her until at least midnight, just let her cry. We feed her the first time she cries after midnight, then we do the same until 3 hours has elapsed since the last feed.

At bedtime, she falls asleep independently fine. But she'll wake up and cry between 9 - 11:30, crying will last 30 min to 1 hour (cycling between crying for 5 min and sleeping for 5 min). She wakes at 12:15-12:30 and we feed her. She does not cry much (0-5 minutes total per night) until 3:30-4am, when we feed again. Then she sleeps without crying until 6-7am. 

The first 3 days were awful (2-3 hours crying per night). She's gotten better (now 1 hour total crying per night), but she hasn't improved in the last week. After 10 nights of this schedule, we were expecting less crying during that first stretch from 7 to midnight. 

Of note, we started doing this CIO schedule the same time we transitioned from Snoo (with swaddle) to crib (just sleep sack).

Any tips or thoughts? Should we try another sleep training method? Try a dream feed? Change our weekend wake windows (unfortunately can't do much about the daycare wake windows)?

My wife and I have been attempting to sleep train our daughter (10 months) for about 8 days now. I think overall its gone very well, she was previously co sleeping with my wife and her sleeping was fairly poor.

2) no further night wake up

307,sleeptrain,"Swaddling transition, need advice!

My baby is 6 weeks old. We have been swaddling her for naps and bedtime. Although she fights daytime naps now, she seems to do pretty well at night. I’m unsure of when to transition her to a sleep sack and need some guidance/advice.

The swaddle we currently use sucks. It’s not a name brand and the velcro pieces are small so it’s easy for her to bust out of. I ordered a Halo swaddle and waiting for it to be delivered. We tried the Love To Dream swaddle with her arms up but she hated it. Even of she falls asleep unswaddled in our arms, she keeps her arms below her neck. With the crappy swaddle we have, we notice she will bust out of it when she grunts, squirms, repositions in the bassinet.

Sometimes she does the newborn curl in the bassinet. At least that’s what I think it is. She also tends to move to the side of the bassinet so her face or body is pressed up against the mesh.

During tummy time, she favors her left side. She has rolled from tummy to back on that side a couple of times but it seems to be a mixture of effort on her part and gravity from her head.

When she is on her back unswaddled, she does not try to move from back to stomach.

I’m terrified of SIDS just like all moms are. I feel like she is in the inbetween stage of swaddling and needing a sleep sack. She doesn’t seem to have enough momentum in the swaddle to go from back to stomach completely, but anytime she does the newborn curl I worry. She is getting stronger but I don’t think she is strong enough to go from back to stomach right now. I’m having a hard time knowing when the best time to introduce a sleep sack would be.

Because of how young she is, I worry about how she will do in a sleep sack. She still has the startle reflex. If we’re holding her, she flails her arms up and out in her sleep. I’ve tried setting her down on the couch when she is asleep (attended just to see what she does) and this arm motion wakes her up immediately and she fusses/cries. So I worry that she is too young for a sleep sack and that she won’t sleep without her arms being contained.

I apologize for this long post but I need advice and guidance on what to do. Do I wait a few more weeks before introducing the sleep sack? The Halo swaddle that I ordered doubles as one.

308,sleeptrain,"Help! Baby’s suddenly waking up again after partial night weaning. Any ideas?

BACKGROUND: Baby is 6.5 months, almost 7. Schedule USED to be fall asleep 7:55-8:05pm, wake up 7:10am. I’d have to wake him half the time. After some gradual weaning we’re down to one night feeding, sometimes two, after 3am. He’s been averaging 10.5 hours total time asleep at night.

We sleep trained a few weeks ago. He puts himself to sleep with a binky but it falls out in the night, or sometimes even before he falls sleep. This causes a few tears if it’s before he’s asleep, but he’s always out within 10 minutes regardless. I replace it after night feedings, but no other time.

We are working on naps—he just got on a three nap schedule maybe two weeks ago. Wake times used to be something like 2.25/2.5/3/2.5, but I’ve been pushing 2.5/2.75/2/2.5 to get longer naps in the daytime with less fussing. It seems to be helping. He gets maybe 2.5 hours of naps a day (he’s always been on the low end of sleep needs).

THE PROBLEM: all of a sudden, baby’s waking up at night and getting up early. Usually waking once or twice between 12 and 2:30am. He’ll go back to sleep after 10-40 minutes of unassisted CIO (I keep an eye on the video monitor for safety). Then he wakes up around 6:40am. I keep him in bed for 15-20 min before wake up.

Am I missing something? I’m fine with the earlier mornings, but the night wakings are tough. I’ve done some days with a bedtime around 7:40, but he just fussed until his usual pass-out time (8ish).

313,sleeptrain,"I personally hate the terms ""overtired"" and ""undertired"". I think each term conflates multiple different issues with opposite origins and fixes, and lead to a ton of confusion. I suspect these are terms coined by the sleep industry to confuse parents. I'm curious what people think about the following distinction and whether it is more helpful (or more confusing!):

1. Preceding wake window (WW) too long
2. Preceding WW too short
3. Sleep deprived
4. Night too long

&#x200B;

1. Preceding WW too long = too much build up of homeostatic pressure.

Signs: Very fussy and tired; Meltdown at the end of WW; Hard to settle at naptime/sleeptime, lots of fussiness; Nap from which baby wakes visibly sleepy and unhappy (crying, fretful, rubbing eyes) and is unhappy early in the next WW; This nap is usually crap BUT sometimes babies may knock out stone cold and sleep through the first cycle transition, but wake up still unhappy and stay unhappy through the next WW; 2-4 hours post-bedtime scream fest seems to be our LO's night version if last WW is too long.

Fix: Shorten preceding WW.

&#x200B;

2. Preceding WW too short = not enough build up of homeostatic pressure.

Signs: Fighting naptime/sleeptime, lots of rolling/crawling/standing in crib; Long sleep/nap latency (time from putdown to asleep); Wakes up in 1 nap cycle or less happy and ready to play; Happy next WW but may get tired early on.

Fix: Lengthen preceding WW.

&#x200B;

3. Sleep deprived = not enough sleep = total wake time too long (by far the most common problem I see around here)

Signs: not meeting the criteria laid out here [https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/zw702y/troubleshooting\_schedule\_101\_figuring\_out\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/zw702y/troubleshooting_schedule_101_figuring_out_your/); in my LO I find the first signs are early morning waking and daytime fussiness/sleepiness (WW shortening).

Fix is complicated because the causes are many and varied, but the key thing to remember is that TOTAL WAKE TIME needs to shorten. As total wake time is the sum of all the WWs, you can achieve shortening by 1) shortening some or all of the WWs OR 2) dropping a nap (eliminating one WW) and lengthening the remaining WWs somewhat.

This is a dynamic process as after your baby catches up on sleep, he/she will need a total wake time that is a bit longer before he/she gets into the problem of night sleep too long.

Three patterns of chronic sleep deprivation I've noticed:

1. cannot sustain age-appropriate WWs and naps long and hard during the day (way above the norm);
2. barely making it through the day with crap naps and passes out for 12-13 hours at night (lucky for the night caregiver, but exhausting for the day caregiver);
3. generally messy sleep but who every few days sleeps a TON.

My LO was a combo of #1 and #3. He doesn't seem to like to sleep >11 hours at night no matter what happens.

&#x200B;

4. Night sleep too long = Circadian malalignment (can be from two causes: daytime sleep too short OR total wake time too short)

Signs: long sleep latency at bedtime, bedtime battles, some forms of false starts (if bedtime one day is a lot earlier than usual bedtime), split nights, toddler shenanigans overnight, early morning waking where the baby is wide awake and ready to start the day.

Fix: Shorten night sleep (early wake up time, later bedtime, or both). The ""freed up"" time needs to be substituted by either daysleep or wake time, depending on the cause. Takes time to work because circadian rhythm takes time to adjust.","Troubleshooting Schedule 101: ""Overtired"" and ""Undertired"" are not Helpful Terms",1672756736.0

I have been reading Weissbluth's book and coming more and more to the realization that our baby has colic. So much has been explained by this. The realization hurts but helps to bear it better. I highly recommend the book and his website. 

if you feel depressed, know that it will get better. The baby will change for the better. It is only a limited time.

It is not your fault that you often can't soothe your baby (when all the basic needs are met). It's okay to put her down sometimes and take a few minutes to recharge your batteries. Sometimes I just lay down in bed with her next to me (when motion didn't help) and put my hand on her chest and take a break. 

It is not your fault if your baby does not sleep alone in his crib or if you do not manage to establish healthy sleeping habits. You can always do that later. I beat myself up so much for this. It's frustrating and exhausting. Try to do everything you can to get your baby to sleep and keep your sanity (i.e. baby wearing, bouncing etc).  

it is not your fault if your baby is overtired Although you are paying attention to wake times etc. This broke me the most. because I was paying attention to everything and it wasn't working. It still gives me panic when I can’t get her to sleep although she is so overtired, but it is not my fault. I gave my best and can’t force her to sleep, just give her the chance.

Seek help from family and friends if possible.

Then for a few days, he would wake up around 4-5 am crying, but giving him a pacifier would get him back to sleep. 

Before this, he would need a very small bottle (2 oz) and then his pacifier from us around 4 to 5:30 am. Once in a while he would wake up before that and we would offer his pacifier. He currently can’t roll over to his back from belly yet so we think that could contribute to the crying. Then we would give him the small bottle and pacifiee if he woke up again. 

Sunday though, he came down with pink eye and def regressed the past two nights. He woke up crying Sunday evening at 3, so I flipped him and gave him pacifier. 3:45 am he’s crying again, so I did the same. Finally, it’s 4:30 am and he’s crying again.

1. Their last nap/catnap consistently ends at 5pm. For the last two weeks that final window has been around 1.5 to 1.75 but the last two nights it’s been 2.5 with lengthier settling. 
2. We have been phasing out the pacifier for about a week and a half. Didn’t do cold turkey and still reached for it when one twin was struggling to settle to keep them in synch as much as possible. However, I’ve not used it for three days until tonight. 
3. Sleepy cues are so much harder to read at the moment which is where I might be going wrong. Their naps are very easy - usually a minute or two of fussing/crying. Crying is elevated at bedtime in their cot. 
4. Currently doing shush pat in their cots until calm then leaving the room. I’m open to the Ferber method and welcome any advise! 
5. Twin A started rolling yesterday, and ended up on her stomach for all naps and at bedtime which didn’t seem to bother her.

328,sleeptrain,"My 7 month old used to be a great sleeper, still is for the most part but now has started waking 1-2 hours after bedtime. I have no idea why this is happening, please help!

Our typical day is:
Wake up 7-7:15am
Nap 1: 9:30ish, 30 min nap
Nap 2: 12:30, 2 hour nap
Nap 3: 4:50, 10-15 min nap

This is based off the “little ones” sleep program and schedules. 

We do a simple bedtime routine, bath every few nights, bottle, wash face/mouth, pjs & diaper, story, sleep sack and a song. He goes into his crib fully awake for bedtime and all naps and generally falls asleep in 5-10 mins with no crying. 

This new wake started when he was sick so I assumed that was it but he is mostly over the cold now and it’s continuing. When he was sick I would always go in and feed him because I wanted to keep him hydrated while sick. Doing this he would fall back asleep while nursing within 5-10 mins. Then I would transfer him back to bed asleep. Sometimes he will sleep for 5-6 hours after this first wake.  We have only been partially successful at getting him back to sleep without feeding, but he has a 5oz bottle before bed so I don’t think he is actually hungry again this quickly.

I seriously can’t function anymore with this little sleep. I feel so defeated hearing people talk about their babies doing 6, 7, 8+ hour stretches at night. I want that so bad! I also feel so overwhelmed because I feel like I have so much to do in such a short amount of time - wean off the pacifer, wean out of the swaddle, get an earlier bed time routine, transition to crib. It’s all so stressful. I have done and followed taking Cara babies course as well as 2 other sleep courses. I feel like I have done everything right but yet I can’t get results! My goal is getting him sleeping by 7:30/8pm - 7am. 

Baby eats at 8pm and is sleeping by 9pm - I have tried so hard to get an earlier bedtime it does not change his sleep at all. 9pm sleeping seems to be when I can get the most time. 

He does not eat again until 6am. I have tried to do the middle of the night feedings and it does not change anything. He is not waking because he is hungry. 

He goes to sleep on his own with a pacifer. Does not need to be rocked, held or anything. We place him in his bassinet awake and he eventually falls asleep. 

He wakes up at 11pm screaming and crying. I place my hand on his chest he will fall back asleep. I have tried waiting 2, 5 and 8 minutes he just gets louder and louder and more upset until he is fully awake. 

He then wakes up at 1:30am and requires the pacifer to fall asleep for the rest of the night. From 1:30am - 6am he is awake every 5-20 minutes. 

He is still swaddled as he has no signs of rolling however he seems to wake up and be mad his hands are pinned because he is always trying to break out of it. I have tried naps with his arms out and he doesn’t sleep his hands/arms wake him up. 

He eats all his calories during the day, doesn’t go longer then 3 hours without eating during the day. He has 4 naps (2 hours, 1 hour, 45 mins and 30 mins). I know, understand and follow his wake windows. I do a lot of stimulation during those wake windows. His longest wake window is before bed. We have a bedtime routine we do every single night.

331,sleeptrain,"My son (2 months old) has not been a naturally good sleeper. He has always slept better in a contact nap and putting him in his bassinet- or even worse his crib- feels like a fight of my will versus his. We now have a whole routine and set up for his bassinet that works for night sleep - though he still seems “behind” on how long of a sleep stretch he will go, most nights 2.5 is still the max. I will also add that my husband works nights, so this whole bedtime and night sleep thing is all in my hands. All I think about, talk about, and read about is newborn sleep. I feel very boring. My son would happily go between nursing and contact napping all day (and maybe all night though I wouldn’t test it), so I’ve had to put a lot of effort into keeping his feeds active and having *some* awake time in the day. I’m working on getting him to nap in his bassinet or crib but that sounds often leads to no naps which leads to no night sleep, so where my will won with the bassinet night sleep, so far his will has won for contact naps as day sleep.

Anyway, I keep reading that though sleep training can’t begin until 4 months, you can start a bedtime routine earlier to begin sleep associations: such as nursing, fresh diaper, pajamas, song (I think this is the suggestion in Precious Little Sleep). My question is this: right now he doesn’t have a bedtime of course. All I can hope for is that he wakes up early enough from his evening nap that he can maybe be sufficiently tired by the time he wants to go to sleep for the night.

He barely cried when we transitioned to independent sleep and falls asleep within 2-10 minutes. We worked with a consultant who I had disagreements with (insisted on nights and naps training at the same time) and while she could provide suggestions in the moment, she never explained any ""why"" or alternative suggestions which has left me with a bunch of questions. This sub has been so helpful already and the help is so appreciated. Schedule is 7:30 wakeup 2/2/2/2.25 7:30-8pm bedtime. Naps can range between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours with total daytime sleep less than 3 hours. 

Problem 1: Naps
Naps have started to consolidate sometimes but the longest nap of the day is usually the 3rd nap and occasionally the 2nd. Is there something I could or should be done differently to get to the desired state of two longer naps for the first and second with the third nap being the shortest? What are the ramifications of this long third nap? We've had a couple false start bedtimes recently so I am assuming that this nap is part of the problem. Is there an issue with my schedule that I should or could adjust? 

Problem 2: Feed Association
LO is put to sleep wide awake for naps and nights with feedings not occuring during the 30 minutes prior. He will occasionally doze during a feed even if it is right after a nap (like right now). I try to keep him awake by tickling etc but any talking at all is far too distracting and he unlatches immediately. I have occasionally used nursing to comfort him when he has woken up crying hysterically but only after all other options have been exhausted and if he is showing strong hunger cues (a specific thing he does everytime he is hungry). He has gone from 1 to 3 night feeds and even had a 4th last night. During the day, I try to feed him as often as he is willing without making it all top-ups (every 2-3 hours). He is still waking up every 2-3 hours to feed during the night. He had been giving one long stretch of 4 hours at the beginning of the night but last night woke during that time to feed. He eats for far longer at night than during the day (half asleep + no distractions) and falls back to sleep while feeding. I always cut him off when I can't hear him actively swallowing. I try to wake him before putting him back in the crib. I sometimes hear him wake up at other times during the night and he puts himself back to sleep without needing a feeding. He is a little guy (15th percentile) so I don't mind continuing to feed if I must, but I really miss longer stretches of night sleep and I am so tired that it is negatively impacting my mental health. Is this a feed to sleep association problem or am I just experiencing a reverse cycling issue?

341,sleeptrain,"Looking for where to start with sleep training. What method worked for you? What might you do differently in retrospect? 

I read ""12 hrs sleep in 12 mo,"" and some ideas were helpful, but I feel it is not geared enough towards breastfeeding.  Baby is a big (16.5lb at 4 mo) and hungry, still eating 10-12 times per 24 hours. At night (which I consider to be 8pm-8am) she wakes to eat 2-4 times. Even as a brand newborn she was not a sleepy baby, not the type who needed to be tickled awake while eating etc.

We have a good bedtime routine happening - she goes down in the crib awake and falls asleep usually with no fuss at all. Everything else is pretty unpredictable, and naps are the hardest. We live in a 1 bdrm apartment - right now her crib is in the main living space and at night we sleep with our bedroom door open.

My ideal would be that she rests in her crib from 8pm-8am except waking once in the night to feed. During the day, any number of naps is fine, but I would like a her to go to sleep on her own. Right now she will only nap while being held, while in the (moving) stroller, while in the wrap while I walk (can't stay still), or in her crib after feeding to sleep or extensive bouncing on the yoga ball and then a pacifier after the transfer to the crib. Her naps are usually 30-40 min. I try to keep the wake window under 2 hours, but it rarely works and usually she is more like 3 hrs between naps.

But…she’s probably one of the worst nappers ever. Some days she fights naps so hard despite our consistent routine. It’s starting to become all contact naps, and if we let her cry it out, she will cry for 20-60 mins which frankly is really hard for me to endure. I could if it was getting better but it seems like crying it out for naps isn’t working for us. I try hard not to let her get over tired and we try for a nap every 2-2.5 hours in the day.

So I actually don’t mind feeding my 10mo once or twice during the night at all, however recently she’s been waking 4+ times in the night and will not settle unless I feed her. It’s gotten to the point that if my partner goes in and tries to settle her she screams as soon as she realises it’s him instead of me. Previously she would let him settle her if she had been fed within the past couple of hours. 

I should add that we put her down awake for naps & at nighttime and she generally falls asleep herself. However I do feed her downstairs before naps/bedtimes (bedtime is feed & brush teeth downstairs, then upstairs for stories, a song then bed awake. Usually asleep within 20mins). 

I know people talk about a 5-3-3 rule or cutting the timings of feeds down, but my little girl is inconsolable if I try to resettle her in the night without a feed.

353,sleeptrain,"Hi all! Question for you all about naps and their impact on night sleep. Baby girl is almost 7 months old and has been a terrific sleeper since the beginning. She was doing 6-8 hour stretches at 2 months and by 3 months was doing 11-12 but it was primarily assisted sleep. Naps were shit - 30-40 minutes. We sleep trained a few weeks ago to encourage independent sleep and lengthen naps. It was very easy - basically fussed it out or rolled over and slept within 10 minutes 90% of the time. Naps immediately improved to 1-2 hours in length and we dropped the 3rd nap altogether. It seems to me though that the long naps seemed to have introduced a 4/5am wake up to eat (will give her 15-20 minutes to settle and sometimes it works). In tracking sleep, we used to get 12-13 hours of total sleep in a 24 hour period and now with improved naps it’s more like 14-15 with the occasional 16 thrown in. Is there a chance she is sleeping too much now? Let me know if you think nap duration could be interrupting night sleep.

354,sleeptrain,"LO is 6 months and has been sleeping with pacifier awake in crib since 10 weeks approx. Never been a problem since he didn’t mind when it fell off when he was in deep sleep. However lately he has been waking up more frequently and have been dropping it more frequently. Thinking of maybe weaning him off it but wanted to ask how I can do it the best way? He goes crazy as soon as it falls off and I had hoped that by now that he had would’ve learned how to insert it himself but he hasn’t. He just screams and waits for us to put it in. So my questions are 
-what is the best way to wean, both slow and cold Turkey 
-can we still use it for stroller rides and car rides and for soothing ?

355,sleeptrain,"Hello everyone,

I'm at a loss with our little girl's schedule at the moment and hoping someone can help me out. She's almost 7 months old. She's been falling asleep independently for 1.5 months now. 

An average day looks like this: 
She's awake around 5:00 / 5:30 am. She'll be ready to go back to bed within 1 hour (!) or so. She then sleeps for a good amount (at least an hour). Her second WW is longer (2:15 hrs) after which she often takes another longer nap. She's awake for another 2:15-ish hrs after that and takes her third nap (30-45 minutes). She'll be awake for 2:45-3 hrs before bedtime at around 6 pm. Usually she has a few short cries at night and has one nursing session. Goes right back to sleep afterwards. 

Because she wants to go back to bed so quickly after waking up in the morning, I've recently decided to not get her out of bed before 6am. I let her cry. She has been falling asleep again most of the times. One time even for 2 more hrs! So for example, this morning she woke at 5am, I waited and she fell asleep again till 6:20am. 

Latest development is she'll wake 35-40 minutes after bedtime. Last couple of days it was only a short cry but tonight it was longer (20 minutes). Not sure if she's over- or undertired. Hard to imagine she's undertired though, as she slept 12hrs at night and 3.5 in naps... I do feel like she needs some more sleep than the average. 

What to do? Do I lengthen the first WW? I've tried this but it was very hard to keep her awake, she was very fussy and her nap afterwards was not as long.  Should I cap her naps? Also tried this for one or two days but don't know for how much max sleep time I should aim. I have a feeling out girl needs some more sleep than suggested online. I'm desperately searching for the sweet spot but can't seem to find it...

Day 2: 17 min cry, one wakeup during night which took 40 min
Day 3: 15 min cry, slept 11 h straight but did wake up 5:20 (we started the day at this point bc scared she wasn’t tired enough for a round for ferbs. But she was grumpy)

358,sleeptrain,"Okay yesterday I posted about how we are doing CIO again. My son slept through the night nye and I was obviously very pleased. He was having a really bad rough patch. Well last night he woke up screaming at 12 am and didn't go down until 2 ish. I was previously nursing him 1 to 2 times a night prior to this session of sleep training and last night he wanted milky. This was the most stubborn I've ever seen him. Usually he cries for like 20 30 min tops. He was very upset and even was hoarse.  I was upset and went into his room and offered him water. He refused his water cup but a few minutes later asked for it and went down. I feel awful for going in because I am afraid I reset the clock but also awful for not nursing him. I am obviously tired too. I just need some encouragement. Another possible contributing factor is that he skipped his nap yesterday. He protested the entire nap. We left him in the crib for an hour but took him out and put him down earlier at like 630. Usual bedtime is 7-730. Was this a result of the skipped nap or does he now think he can protest as long as possible to get his way? Did I go to fast on night weaning? I kept telling myself he doesn't need milk but I feel bad that he seems to need the comfort.  

His schedule is as follows but sometimes we are late with the naps on weekends when he is home so maybe we need to be more consistent there:

359,sleeptrain,"Hello!

My almost 16 month old has been pretty consistent with a bedtime of 8PM, waking around 7-7:30AM. She has a 2-2.5 hour nap (12:30-2:30/3) in the middle of the day. 

In the past 3 weeks, when she's not sick, has suddenly decided that 6AM is her new waking hour. I'll admit that this less desirable for us, hence our 8PM bedtime. Sometime she seems rested, but sometimes she seems tired and is yawning all morning. We moved her nap up to 12. I don't want to put her to bed any earlier out of concern she'll wake even earlier. 

I'm a bit confused by the sudden switch and am not sure if she just doesn't need as much sleep anymore. I do know her 4 molars are coming through and I wonder if that has anything to do with it.

362,sleeptrain,"I hate baby sleep. 

My 13.5 month old has struggled with sleep since day one and my husband and I are beyond exhausted. We are at a total loss. 

In short: about 2 weeks ago, we decided to drop to one nap because our baby was struggling going down for his second nap, waking regularly before 5am and experiencing split nights every 3-4 days. 

The first day on a new schedule worked great. He slept from 7-6:40 and we thought we were onto something. But then the split nights kept happening and slowly became more frequent. Now he’s up every night reliably from 11-2:30/3. This is unsustainable. My husband works 9-5 and I’m a flight attendant. I have to sometimes get up as early as 3am to go to work. We need to figure something out that eliminates these split nights. 

But what? 

Do we try going back to 2 naps and just deal with a bedtime that is 9:30 or later (as well as super early wakes)? Everything I read about split nights says that he doesn’t have enough sleep pressure, but that doesn’t seem to apply since his last wake window is currently approaching 6 hours. 

The sample schedule is:

Wake up: 7
Nap: 12-1:30
Bedtime: 7-7:30

The times have been tweaked a bit earlier and later, but nothing seems to work. Is he overtired? We’ve had no problem at all stretching his wake windows and he’s going to sleep fairly easily compared to when we were on 2 naps.",Split nights and the 2-1 transition,1672674381.0
363,sleeptrain,"Baby has always been an awful sleeper. Things really turned for worse at 3.5 months. He is breastfed (no dairy and no obvious soy in my diet due to cmpa) and is on a 14 day treatment of famotidine for silent reflux. We assumed he started his sleep regression early at 3.5 months when sleep went from every 2-3 hours to every hour overnight. Then we noticed the reflux was so bad he would wake up crying, hoarse and with wet burps. That’s pretty under control now. Then he started teething. It’s been about a week or two since his teething pains have kept him up. We don’t think teething is waking him up now.


He wakes up every hour after we put him to sleep at 7:30-8. I usually feed him at 11 then husband and I go to bed. Then baby wakes up every 45 min. All night. He wakes up on his belly (he sleeps on his side or belly) and can’t turn back around. I try to feed him every 3 hours overnight but it’s so chaotic now that sometimes we just nurse him back to sleep if he’s extra fussy and won’t settle after waking. Most nights my husband just ends up transferring baby from crib in nursery to our bed for co-sleeping so he can settle baby before full on meltdown and hold him in place so he doesn’t turn over and get stuck. Even this isn’t working anymore. And I’m tired of sleeping in the guest bedroom alone since I won’t cosleep with them.  I think my husband is more sleep deprived than he lets on too, but prioritizes my sleep over his. ☹️ Baby takes 3-4 naps during day - 9-9:30/12/3 and maybe one more depending on how his previous naps went). His nap cues are very obvious. Naps are 30 min- 1 hour. He’ll wake up between 5:30-7:30 am for the day. If he wakes early, he won’t truly wake up. He just moves and kicks a lot with his eyes closed. I’ll nurse him to extend a bit - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.

She was sleep trained at 6 months and is normally an excellent sleeper… normally, we do our bedtime routine, I put her in the crib, kiss her good night and she goes to sleep happily on her own  for around 11 hours. 

The last couple nights, I notice in the monitor that she immediately sits up in her crib after I leave. Stays like that for a solid 30-45 mins, until she basically falls over. She will sleep the first chunk of the night laying down (I wake periodically during the night and check the monitor) but usually around 3, she wakes herself up again and spends the rest of the night sitting. I can see her head bobbing as she dozes off while fighting to stay upright. As far as I know, she won’t lay down again for the entire rest of the night.

We have a very stubborn, highly aware, very active 10 month old. She has been walking for a month and is all over the place. She was waking up multiple times a night and had to be rocked/nurse multiple times throughout the night to go back to sleep. She would often wake up as soon as she was put down and then go on to stand in the crib until someone came and helped her. 

For sleep training, I was agreeable to 7-10 minutes of crying without comforting. We started with leaving and coming back and helping her fall asleep while in the crib (patting her belly, sitting by her) which was an improvement but she was still have a few night wake ups.

I really like TCB approach in general, but she suggests keeping the night feed at 11pm max and waking baby instead of responding to crying. Why not in the middle of the night? Should I let baby wake up naturally or create a dream feed instead... Is there a  consensus  on that?

I’ll try give as much info as I can, but I’m so desperate for sleep and it’s heavily impacting my mental health. Nothing I google helps. I should count my lucky stars, because I know so many mums are still doing multiple night feeds at this age, and have it so much worse, so I can’t understand why this affects me so much but I just want him to sleep better for both of our sakes. 

I’ll link his routine first to save you reading the rest of the details:
6am- wake, feed, change, play in the living room/sit in high chair at the table while I have my coffee.
8am- first nap (30 mins long)
10am- feed
11.30- second nap (30 mins long)
2pm- feed
2.30/3pm- last nap (30 mins long)
4pm-outside time
5pm- dinner (unusually banana/pear as it’s the only food we’ve currently found doesn’t upset his tummy)
5.30pm-bath time (30 minute bath in bath oil for eczema)

Some background info about him:
He’s a big baby, currently sitting at the 100th percentile for everything so drinks a lot of milk. He has CMPI which caused a lot of issues in the beginning because we didn’t know what was wrong. This resulted in a lot of co sleeping and terrible habits so he and I could be comfortable when he had a sore tummy. There was actually a period of maybe a month where he was sleeping through and I wish I could remember what we did back then. He’s also got really awful eczema which is only tamed by a buttload of bath oil and oily eczema lotion every night. 

The problem:
sometimes the time he wakes at 1, sometimes it’s 3. I really don’t know what makes it change. He slept through the other night for the first night in months, so I wrote down everything we did that day. I copied it to a T and still, he woke up again. 
When he wakes up, it’s like he’s frustrated. He tries to close his eyes, settle himself and go to sleep, but I watch him get comfy, and then his hands start moving around and he’s uncomfortable again, cries and is frustrated, which is when I need to intervene and help. 

He unfortunately cat naps and has since I can remember. Currently they’re only 30 minutes long 3x a day. He does 12 hours overnight so I don’t know if that’s related to it, but he honestly seems constantly tired. He’s grumpy about an hour after waking in the morning and is upset after he wakes despite not attempting to go back to sleep. As soon as he sees me and opens his eyes he’s happy again but so sooky and cranky. It’s like he’s just perpetually tired all the time no matter what.

What I’ve tried:
I believe possibly his issue is because of his naps, but I have 0 clue on how to extend them. I’ve extended them by being able to co sleep by napping with him in my bed, I did this for the first time in 3 months and it threw him off being able to settle himself for over a week, so it’s out of the question. It also didn’t help him sleep although it was only one nap and it was almost two hours long. He can sometimes be tired as early as an hour after waking, but if I put him down it’s a screaming match. He loses his mind and suddenly isn’t tired anymore. I accept that he isn’t tired enough and we simply leave and play for a bit longer.  

It took me forever to figure out when he was getting tired enough to sleep and I think our current routine is fairly close but I’m obviously very open to altering it because he is so constantly tired.

I usually follow the same routine for naps as I do bed time. I’ve tried the drowsy but awake. I’ve tired letting him put himself to sleep. I’ve tried no dummy (only for a couple of days, should we try for longer?). Most nights he falls asleep without a dummy anyways. He has a riff raff, a noise machine. I use lavender.

We sleep trained my first at 4 months with the Ferber method, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life, but he has slept great since and even night weaned himself at 6 months. I guess it just feels so different with this baby because she's actually been pretty good at putting herself to sleep, 'dowsy but awake' actually worked (with my first that phrase made me want to scream as much as he did). It just makes it feel like if she is waking up and not getting to sleep then something must be wrong since I know she knows how.

378,sleeptrain,"Our 8.5mo was initially trained with Ferber around 5 months - it lasted basically a few weeks and then slowly things have completely unraveled thanks to illness, teething, and travel, so we're back to fighting bedtime and wakes every 2-3 hours overnight. We want to refresh her training, but it was really hard for me psychologically to listen to her cry the first time, so I'm really hoping to do this right from the beginning and not need to do too much troubleshooting.

I want to make sure I have her schedule right. Her biological clock seems to shift towards sleeping in later/ staying up later, so right now the plan is: 7:30 wake, 10:30-11:30 nap 1, 2:30-3:30 nap 2, start bedtime 7:30, asleep by 7:45/8 - essentially 3/3/4. Does that sound reasonable for 8.5mo? 

I'm also worried she's reverse cycled her feeding a bit and is now getting too many calories at night. She is exclusively breastfed so it's hard to know exactly how much she's getting at each feed. I'm afraid that when she wakes up at night and cries for hours I will cave thinking she's hungry. Is it an option to do the 5/3/3 thing where you don't go in to feed unless it's been at least 5 hours, or is she too old for that? I'd like to transition her back to eating mostly during the day with night weaning over a week or so just for my own peace of mind knowing I'm not starving my child in the middle of the night.

379,sleeptrain,"Baby number 2 is almost 8 months old. My first born stopping waking for feeds at around 6 months old. Weaned himself. Once he was done eating at night he didn’t ever need much intervention. 

My second is a completely different story and I’m not sure what to do. For the most part she puts herself to sleep. Naps and bedtime I can put her to bed awake and she will go to sleep (outside of a regression). At 2 months old she was sleeping 7-7 it was glorious. Granted she was in a snoo, she didn’t have to eat anymore. I thought we were so lucky.. fast forward to the 4 month regression. Even since then, she’s up atleast twice a night. Cries, eats, back to sleep. It takes less than ten mins and I usually am half asleep nursing her so it’s not a huge deal but I would just love to have consecutive sleep again. 

I guess my question is, how do I sleep train her? I always thought sleep training was getting a baby to fall asleep on their own at bedtime or nap.

380,sleeptrain,"Our guy is going to be 7 months old next week. We haven’t sleep trained yet. I rock him to sleep and he uses a pacifier. Bedtime routine is boob, bath, diaper, jammies + sleep sack, white noise, rocking + binky. He usually falls asleep pretty easily with 5-10 mins of rocking.

Right now our schedule is wake up 630, wake windows 2.5/2.5/2.5/2.5-3ish on non daycare days. His naps at home are anywhere 30 mins-2 hours but I cap them at 1.5 hours now for the first two and have him up by 5pm from the last nap. It’s rare that he gets more than 3 hours of daytime sleep though.

 On daycare days they seem to do ~3 hour wake windows and he only squeezes in two naps. Usually 25-45 mins, rarely 1.5 hours. My husband will often try to get him another nap when he gets home from daycare (~430pm) but it’s really hit or miss. He’s often pretty tired on daycare days.

For a while he was sleeping 7ish to 6 or 630 with one wake up to eat around 4am and going back to sleep easily. That felt sustainable. Slowly over the last month or so he’s waking up at least twice, usually between 1230-130 and again 3ish hours later. He won’t be soothed by rocking, only by a feed. It also got really tough to get him to stay asleep after these wake ups/feeds. He goes back to sleep easily but wakes up a few minutes after being put in his crib and needs to be held/rocked to sleep again. Sometimes that happens twice. Then he often wakes up around 5 or 530 and cannot go back to sleep so I bring him into bed with us and he crashes out until I wake him at 630. I moved his bedtime to 730 to try to shift everything (MOTN and morning wake up) a bit later with limited success.

All of this sleep deprivation brings us to sleep training. I’m planning on CIO. Here are my questions:

1. Given that his daycare and home schedule are different, is it better to start sleep training over a long weekend when I have control over his daytime sleep?
2. Does our schedule look like it needs tweaking? I want to set him up for success with sleep training.
3. I don’t need to completely night wean, I’d be okay with one night feeding. We’ll likely work on that next starting with eliminating the 1230-130 wake up. For MOTN wake ups during sleep training that aren’t feedings, do we just let him CIO? I just hate the thought of him actually being hungry and us ignoring it. Do I err on the side of feeding him?

Right now our main focuses are to remove a feed-to-sleep association which is actually going really well, as he put himself to sleep for all of his naps except his third one (patted his butt only). He also fell asleep independently tonight. We are also hoping fixing his wake windows will help him consolidate his naps and stop his false starts (he wakes up 30-40 minutes after falling asleep every night and only goes back to sleep with a bottle - which is why we are fixing the association).

Our daughter has been a pretty good sleeper, at 3 months she was sleeping 12 hours through the night but once we hit the 4 month sleep regression, she wakes up at least twice during the night, but I wanted to wait until she was a little over 5 months to start. 

Although I’m pretty confident & I know the benefits, I can’t help but feel a little nervous! Mostly, because I am afraid I won’t be consistent or I’ll give up & give in. 

Tonight I gave her a bath, bottle, read a book & rocked her & laid her down awake with sound machine on. She hasn’t made a peep at all, but I think it’s because she was super tired & ready for bed, she probably didn’t have the energy to care that she wasn’t fully asleep! So, I told my husband tonight might be an exception & we shouldn’t get our hopes up that she won’t shed any tears! And I fully expect her to wake up in about 2/3 hours, and I will follow protocol!

What is the best sleep training to try for a 14.5 months old baby?


A bit of background:
My son was sleep trained using ferber method when he was 6 months old. Worked out well and so happy..
However, he started going to a horrible daycare when he turned 8 months old and went downhill. He was always sick for 4 months and he needed us.. 
We gave him cuddle and rock to sleep to ease his pain..


We were able to transfer him to a different daycare when he turned 12.5 months old and his health became better..
But we are now stuck with rocking to sleep.
Frequent night wake ups (not even reaching a 4 hour cycle!!)
Crying and standing in crib 
And eventually sleep beside us because we are too tired to function...



I thought the transition of 2 to 1 nap will magically solve this... but i was wrong.
4.5-5.5 / nap for 1.5 (if lucky 2 hrs) / 5.5-6 hrs is his awake time
We have a solid night time routine and his room is dark...


Should we still persevere with ferber method? Or is there any better way??

Anyway, bedtime is 8ish. When putting her down, either my husband or I sing her a couple songs after the lights are out and then lay her down (awake, but relaxed) and walk out. She’s quiet for a few minutes. 

Then she starts fussing and eventually crying. Usually she doesn’t stand up, but very infrequently she also stands up to protest. We wait about 10 or 15 mins and then one of us goes back in and resettles her. That can just be back pats and more song. Or if needed, picking her up and singing. Always staying in her dark room.

Due to lack of support and being snapped at, I left his dad and moved in with my family.
Now we are at 11months and I need to be able to sleep on my own since I'm going to be going back to work...and let's face it for my sanity.
My son is very stubborn and Ferber is not an option because he just gets angry if I talk to him while he's crying so I'm trying CIO extinction.
Im currently on day 3 with no improvement, i kmow its early but it feels like its not working.
At night time he takes about an hour or just over to fall asleep- crying almost the whole time until he is finally so exhausted he starts to fall asleep sitting up and then eventually falls over and sleeps.
Nap times are non existing he hasn't napped in 2 days. I was told only let him cry for 20-30 minutes and then try again, ive done that and hes so exhausted he tries to fall asleep in my arms when i get him out. So i sometimes wait a bit feed him, either breast or solids and then try again. But I'm failing, I've even tried to let him go for 1hr for nap and it's just not working. 
His wake windows are 2.5-2.75/3/3.5-4
He's crying so much he's losing his voice and now has super bad separation anxiety.

We sleep trained our LO about 2 weeks ago with ferber for nights and that has gone well. She now goes asleep in a few mins and usually without much protest except for days where the schedule has been very off.

We started nap training about 3 days ago and just with the first nap of the day. The first day she cried about 24mins, the second day about 2mins and today 10mins before going asleep. She had been (sometimes but not consistently) taking a long nap for the first nap either after being rocked and put in her crib or I would lie down on my bed with her. I would sometimes get a 1.5-2hr nap this way. Nap 2 was still short no matter what and would need to be extended however now nap 1 is short and we havent been able to lengthen nap 2 with any of our usual methods. She has also refused to nap past 5pm and so has refused her 3rd nap some days.

Unfortunatley this has meant that the schedule has been way off a few days and resulted in more crying at bedtime. So I guess I'm wondering a few things. Is this something we are doing wrong with our WW or schedule? Or any advice on how to lengthen the naps? Should we drop to 2 naps now that she is 6 months? How long do people find the nap training takes to make a difference?

With this schedule, he usually wakes up around 9 to eat and then again between 12-2. We have tried to drop his 9 PM feeding, but it usually leads to him screaming for a good chunk and makes falling asleep even harder.

Any advice or changes for our little guy? We are considering going to bottle fed exclusively since he has been fighting my wife a bit in the evenings and we can't be sure he is getting enough milk when he is feeding.

438,sleeptrain,"My wife and I started sleep training our daughter 3 weeks ago when she turned 5 months via cry-it-out at night. Initially she cried \~50 mins and this gradually came down to 10-15 mins. She now seems to have plateaued around 10-15 min of crying each night over the past 10 days or so. 

Throughout the process we have been pretty consistent with a 730PM bedtime. We use white noise and a regular bedtime routine. After she falls asleep she wakes once to feed around 1AM and goes back to sleep quite easily. She wakes around 7-730AM. Overall this has been a very positive change for us compared to how things were before, but we were hoping she might eventually not cry at all or only for a couple of minutes at bedtime. As we finish out last bedtime story and start to say good night she recognizes the pattern and gets upset. As I hold her near the crib she starts trembling and screaming before I even put her down. 

We have been focusing on independent sleep at night prior to independent naps. For naps she still almost always falls asleep while being snuggled by one of us. Could the nap habits be interfering with her night time sleep training?

Is it normal to have 10-15 mins of crying lingering like this at bedtime? Or is there anything we might try to make things smoother for her? Thanks so much!",Sleep training plateau?,1672544028.0

My kid has never been a good sleeper. We’ve gotten him to fall asleep independently for naps and bedtime but whenever he wakes up in the MOTN which is always, I bring him to bed and we co-sleep pretty well together (husband and I don’t sleep in the same room because of this, which works for us, but is important in the problem). My kid usually comes to sleep with me and goes right to bed. The last three nights, he has woken up PANICKED and screaming for his dad. He is a daddy’s boy most of the time, but at night he never cared. He’s getting older (19 months) so maybe now he’s just processing that even though it’s just mom getting me I know dad is here? I watch him 6 out of 7 nights. My husband works a way harder job than I do and gets up two hours before me, so I don’t mind and I get enough sleep. But now with this? I am so stressed his sleep is just going to get worse and worse. I am not a big fan of CIO in the MOTN.

Our poor boy (we have 5.5 month boy girl twins) is not doing well with Ferber at night! He was a champ for naps and after the first nap and only going in twice he falls asleep within 15mins during the day.

Night time is a whole other story! First night we put him down waited until he started crying and went in 3 times...decided it was only egging him on so stopped until it was an hour since we started going in, I rocked him to sleep which took another 20ish mins before he fell asleep...tonight was the same but I only went in once to see if it would make things worse and it seemed like it did :(

Is an hour not long enough, should we really stick to the check in times even if it seems to upset him when we leave? He settles immediately when I enter the room and while I sooth him in his crib but when I leave its either as soon as I leave or like a minute later...

I have seen some people say the first 3-4 nights where the worse and then it got shorter...should we just let him go until he falls asleep tomorrow night and check in with night 3 times or start back at night 1 times? Its sooo hard!!

Really struggling with where to go from here since he hasn't put himself to sleep either night we have tried.

Hi everyone,

I made a post recently about sleep difficulties and some of the responses were great. I am currently making this post with noise cancelling headphones.  

Basically, my almost 30 month old has been an escalating nightmare to put to sleep probably since she stopped taking a bottle of milk 1-2 months before she turned 2. She’s very resistant to anything we suggest and is very strong willed. She’s maybe a handful of times said she’s tired. If prompted, she says “I don’t want to sleep anymore.”

Historically she has been a good sleeper, sleeping through the night since about 3.5 months old. The struggles began when we took her bottle away. At least she was contained in her crib and did well with her stuffed animal. Within the past 1-2 months, she’s been fully undressing herself, climbing out of her crib, full on blood curdling screams for long periods, etc. We took the crib rail off her crib so now she has the choice of a bed or her crib without a rail. Her door has a safety lock on the outside. Her room is safe. When my husband or I read to her and I even will cuddle with her for 5-10 mins and tell her well in advance that’s what’s happening, she still freaks out and cries for a long period. Last night she didn’t go to bed until nearly 11pm. First, fully undressing herself. She had taken a 1.5-2 hour nap and was woken up at 4pm. 

Today, we decided no nap. We had a 30 min drive around her nap time and she didn’t fall asleep. She’s usually up around 6:30am. It’s almost 7:30pm and she’s still crying. We put her sleeper on backwards. Her sleep sack on backwards. Short of duct taping I don’t know what else to do. We really would like to have her sleep independently. I have a baby I nurse to sleep and both my husband and I work full time. We need evenings to ourselves (separately, not even together) to get some kind of rest in the day. 

I am about ready to hire a sleep consultant. I am curious if any of you have experienced this and any advice. A good friend of mine says her sleep consultant says they need to stay in the crib until age 3, but she can fully undress herself and then climb out, so I don’t think that’s a great idea.  The other suggestion was to have one of us sit in a chair in her room until she sleeps but as we saw last night, that could be a very long time. Part of me wonders if she has some anxiety or something causing her to act like this or if this is normal toddler behaviour.

He can fall asleep indepedently and links most naps during the day.

Our question is about night feeding as luckily our baby dropped night feeds at about 3 months and has been growing well.

We've never actually had a bedtime before 7:30pm and my wife is terrified of putting him to sleep earlier as she is scared that baby will wake up hungry overnight and we will be forced to re-introduce regular night feeds. Usually he sleeps from about 8pm to 7am without feeds.

I understand that early bedtimes are sometimes required when transitioning/dropping a nap, is it likely that if we are forced to put baby to sleep at 6pm he will wake up hungry before his DWT of 7am?

We are also worried about re-introducing a dream feed too as our baby didn't cope with them well in the past as he would be very awake for a while after it.

447,sleeptrain,"I am struggling with the timing of the last nap for my 11 week old baby. We are following wake windows/sleepy cues so don’t really have a set nap schedule but, depending on length of naps, have four to six naps a day.  We shoot for a bedtime between 7:45 - 8:15. We have a snoo, baby sleeps in own room with noise machine. He typically has one night feeding 4 - 6 hours after he goes to sleep but can go the whole night without one. We contact nap and they range from 45 min to 3 hrs (I cut them off at 3).

Where I am struggling is how to handle evenings. If his last nap ends at 5 pm (which it has the last few nights), he can’t really making it to his ideal bedtime without becoming overtired. We try to put him down again around 6 (one hour wake windows, showing sleepy cues) but he won’t have it. He just melts down regardless if he’s being held or in his bassinet. It’s a huge mental drain in the evenings and I get really frustrated.

I guess my question is what to do in this situation when the last nap of the day doesn’t align with bedtime? Do we continue to try to put him down for a quick evening nap?

For context, I did 7 days of sleep training (incremental check ins) at 4mo and definitely saw the fruits of that labor for a period of time. And then we get Covid, LO included, and it basically threw any semblance of a sleep routine out the window and put us in survival mode, just do what it takes for all of us to get any solid sleep.

Then daycare starts up and all of the illnesses that come with it. Constant sickness, sound sleep seems like a distant memory. LO takes two 20-30m naps between 8:30-3:30.

Fast forward to present day, and a typical night goes something like this - 5:30-6:15 nurse/bath/books, 6:30 rock LO in arms around nursery, lights out, white noise, binkie. 6:30-7 fussing/fighting bedtime more often that not. Transfer LO to crib once they’re 99% asleep and pray to the sleep gods they don’t wake up.

From there, they will usually wake up twice between 7-9:30. We have gotten in habit of going in and picking LO up, partly because partner can’t stand to hear baby cry, but mostly because its just how we’ve been coping. 

Usually by midnight, LO is in bed cosleeping with one or both of us. 3 or so wakes throughout the night, 2ish dream feed/nursing, awake at 6am.

I’m sure it could be much worse, but none of us are sleeping particularly well and it’s just rough knowing that as soon as we get LO down for bed, we’re basically just counting the minutes until they’re awake again, and the cycle repeats.

460,sleeptrain,"Hello! Our LO is exactly 4 months old and was a fairly consistent night sleeper (1 wake up a night for a feed, going back down to sleep almost immediately afterwards) up until about 3.5 months.

She hit the 4 month sleep regression slightly early, leading to much more nighttime fussiness that we’re keen to nip in the bud, if that’s at all possible..! We feel she had pretty good sleep habits (regular bedtime routine, only about 5-10 minutes to get to sleep at bedtime with no holding/ rocking, and regular naps at the same time during the day) which we have tried to keep as consistent as possible since the regression hit. 

Her wake windows are 2/2.25/2.25/2 - generally waking up at 7am and sleeping for bedtime between 6:30pm-7:00pm. We’re interested in sleep training using Ferber at 5 months, but feel it may be a little early now to employ. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is on the following: 

1. Are the wake windows above suitable/ appropriate for a baby of her age? She has 3 naps (45-60 mins in the morning, 90-120 mins at lunch and 15-30 mins late afternoon - these have become much more of a struggle to get her down for in the last week or so). 
2. Is there anything you would recommend we can do now to try and help her in her nighttime fussiness? We do try to leave her if she’s just fussing and not crying, but it nearly always ends in crying that can quickly turn hysterical. 
3. Do you think starting sleep training (Ferber) now rather than waiting until she’s 5 months would be beneficial? 

A few other notes: 

- She used to sleep in a swaddle sleeping bag, which we have moved her out of for nighttime (although she is still this in during naps as they are so difficult to get her down for!). This has caused some challenges with her arms startling and accidentally removing her dummy, but as she will need to move out of this when she begins rolling we felt it was beneficial to transition her sooner rather than later.
- She uses a dummy to get to sleep, spitting it out as soon as she has settled herself.
- In the last 2 weeks she has on a few occasions at night been able to self settle after fussing without a dummy/ us helping which is amazing. However, it seems very hit and miss as to when this occurs. 
- We can’t find a pattern between her nap sleeping and nighttime sleeping. I thought that the days where she has great naps would equal less fussing at night, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. If anything, the last few days suggest the opposite.
- She’s pretty good at the initial bedtime put down - taking maybe 5-10 minutes to get to sleep with us going in 2-3 times max to put her dummy in if it falls out.

I haven’t been going in during these night wakes because he isn’t crying or really making much noise at all other than a few sneezes and some coughs. He’ll also wriggle around, grab at the pacifiers in the crib, and roll back and forth. He is usually able to put himself back to sleep too (I’ll sometimes go in quickly and either replace his pacifier or move some in his direction so he can replace it himself). 

Should I be worried that his overall night sleep has been going down while he’s sick? With these wakeups he’s only getting around 9.75 hours of night sleep and those hours are broken up. I know sleep is very important for babies who are sick and I’m worried he isn’t getting restorative night sleep. 

(Ive given him some baby Tylenol before bed as well as put a humidifier in the nursery. I also aspirate his nose during the day as needed. Oh and I have baby cough syrup but I’m worried to give that at the same time as the Tylenol.)",Sleep and Sickness,1672465565.0

The longest she cried was the first night for about 45 mins and each night it got increasingly shorter. However when she wakes in the middle of the night (which did decrease since the sleep training but still happens 2-3 times usually) she will not settle on her own. She will just progressively get more and more worked up until she is scream crying and it’s been so long and I just can’t have her upset like that anymore. I won’t leave her for hours to cry, I just can’t. Is she just not ready? Is she just not a candidate?

I’ve tried again a couple times recently and same thing, cried with no letting up. Still falls asleep great on her own with no fussing 85% of the time. The times she does fuss it’s only for like 15-20 minutes max. Why is the night wake ups so different? She obviously knows how to fall asleep on her own, but she just won’t do it after the start of the night.

We have an 8 month old daughter who has never been an awesome sleeper. We sleep trained using Ferber at 5 months and saw some progress, but then it quickly regressed to waking every 1-2 hours. We gave Ferber a second shot and again there’s been some progress in her ability to put herself back to sleep at times, but it seems to not have fully worked again. Every night is different. Sometimes there are still tears at bedtime, sometimes no wakes during the night, sometimes 1-3 wakes. We are following age appropriate wake windows.

It seems like the common advice is to stop sleep training and try again one month later, but what do we during that month? Do we go back to rocking/feeding her when she wakes, or try letting her CIO but to a lesser degree?

Sleep trained at 4.5 months with Ferber and she took to it beautifully. Goes into the crib wide awake at bedtime and her 1 nap and falls asleep independently within 5-10 minutes, 99% of the time without any crying/fussing. 

When she wakes in the night, I give her a good 10-15 minutes to figure things out on her own before I go in to comfort her. Because she can and does sleep independently, I assume a prolonged night waking or excessive crying means something is actually wrong.

I'm not convinced it isn't one of or all of those things, but I'm not sure what to do.

So we started FIO/CIO for naps, and the first nap of the day is always terrible: he usually cries for an hour until nap time is over, and then is super cranky until the second nap of the day. It's also heartbreaking to hear him cry for a full hour. He can never calm himself for this first nap.

We didn't do super formal sleep training so I'm sure we're doing something wrong.

Baby was a champion sleeper at first likely due to time in the NICU. Shes never been a cuddler or super into contact naps. Around 6 months things got very bad. She had to be fed and rocked to sleep and then put down perfectly or she'd start the whole thing again.

We broke her of that by I guess a cry it out but she never cried very long. We'd check in after 10 or so minutes and maybe offer more milk.

We got to the point where she'd either fuss for about 5 min or she would fall asleep eating but then could be easily transfered.

The past 2 weeks she's been going completely nuclear at nap time. She won't be rocked to sleep or comforted. She squirms and cries but then has a mental breakdown in her pack n play. She does eventually sleep but it's breaking my heart.

We're on a 2-3 nap schedule depending on wakeup time doing a rough 2/3/4 based on cues.  I'm thinking she's becoming over tired? I've never had any luck putting her down before she's really ready which is what I think our overall issue is.

Maybe this is just normal? I really don't judge CIO and know you have to be strong but it should end at some point right? She just fell asleep after only about 3 minutes of crying but it was very very dramatic crying.

507,sleeptrain,"We've been trying to sleep train our 4.5month old using ferber, and tonight would be night 3 but we've seen lots of wake ups after short periods and are not sure if this is normal/ we should reconsider.

Baby has always been a dreadful sleeper, really hard to put down from arms, and it git worse sometime after the 2 month mark, when he developed half-hourly wakings for a period, which eventually developed into hourly wakes. We'd managed to find he could be settled in cot for some wakes by sleeping whilst holding his hands+keeping a hand on his chest and repeatedly inserting pacifier which has helped a bit, but still getting very fragmented sleep and back is killing me from sleeping with atms reaching nto the nexttome crib (and not completely sure where this sits on safe sleep..). He's also a nightmare to get to sleep at the start of night, as will only fall asleep when held but wakes incredibly easily on crib transfer, resulting in some nights spending up to 2hrs trying to get him to sleep and transfered into crib, with lots of crying which seemed inconsolable at times no matter what i did. He also routinely had false starts, waking up 10mins after in  crib.

With all this we aren't really coping, so it felt like we had to try sleep training.

 Day 1 was painful  but he did fall asleep in about 40minutes (!!). Woke up after 48mins but that's typical of his normal hourly pattern,and he managed a 3hr stretch at one point inthe middle of night (although did have some short stretches scattered in the night - one 10mins and 2x 30mins. We did two feeds and he took a few checking to resettle after each of these too (resettled more quickly, <10mins, after the short sleeps, maybe took 30mins of crying after the feeds)

Night 2, seemed to sleep after 1 checkin but only stayed asleep around 3minutes. After c30-35mins from original bedtime he slept again,this time for 10mins, woke up resettled after 1min and slept for 17mins. Then woke, 10mins crying (with one checkin)  slept 14mins, woke again, 10mins crying/one checkin, slept 12mins, woke, 10mins crying/one checkin and slept for 2h38. Fed him, back in cot, then cried 10mins before sleeping 10mins,then woke up, cried for 55mins before sleeping for 40mins, then woke/criedfor 6mins before sleeping for another 24mins - at which point it was nearly 5am so I gave up forthw night and took him to our bedroom where did a feed and slept him via handholding (with wakes after 1h40 and 50mins) until 8am wake time.

Our schedule us a bit iffy - been trying to do  wake windows of 1.5 - 2hrs, but sometimes he seems really tired early into a window so we've done as short as 1hr, and we did one attempt at pram nap which backfired leaving him awake for 2.5hrs. Been doing 3-4 naps depending how the naps go but usually 4 (sometimes get 1h30 on contact naps, sometimes only 20-30mins, particularly in non ideal conditions eg pram).

Wake at 8am. Been having last nap end around 7:15 and put in cot at 9:30 on night 1 and 9:15 on night 2 as he seemed extra tired.

I think the bedtime is too late and he seems super tired early,particularly in the last window.  However our struggles and1-2hr attempts to get him to sleep habe meant multiple 10pm starts over the last week so not sure whether we should avoid moving too far from this for the initial training. In the bedtime struggles he'd often fall asleep earlier being held (maybe as early as 8:30) but would wake when trsnsfereed to crib. This meant we had some very long wake windows for the last window on 10pm nights (think worst one was 3h44mins from last nap to time asleep in cot - at that point we'd been ending last nap at 6:15ish).

I'm also worrying whether he might be a little ill,  as some of the crying has gone a bit high pitched, but I'm not sure if that's just a slightly sore throat from crying so much with many wake ups / me being paranoid, given no fever etc.

I'm not sure what to do from here, thoughts;

#1 - try night 3 same as night 2. Should we be expecting struggles whilst he learns,and shouldn't mess with timing?
#2 - try an earlier night for night 3? He was seeming very tired at 8pm last night.. are all the short sleeps because he's overtired? And if so, how much should we move bedtime by? Small amount to avoid too much change or do a big shift and aim for butt in crib at [8pm] when he seems tired? (And move last nap accordingly or do short window)?

#3 - give up for now and try again in [a week] after attempting to bring bedtimr earlier/improve schedule in some way - but no guarantee we'll be able improve things given how hard he is to get to sleep and I'm really struggling to cope. And what should we be aiming for?
#4 - does the high-pitched crying mean he could be ill, or normal reaction to lots of crying? :( in which case, would we stop for now and let him recover? He's had a similar amount of sleep on sleep training as as in other nights this week, but lots more alone crying rather than being comforted during :(. He's not got a fever or anything, and seems alert during the day but his voice is bit squeaky so think he has a sore throat - whether from lots of crying or has picked up a cold somewhere 

Other notes 
- he takes a pacifier for naps, but we've gone cold turkey with it for nights as part of the training - although I did let him have it for the last hour of sleep last night where he was already in my bed and I was worrying if he might be ill.
- we've moved him to cot in his own room from next to me crib, although I've been sneaking in and sleeping on floor out of sight as paranoid about SIDS risk/ whether we should still be room sharing
- have a bedtime routine with nappy change, sleep sack, books.  He usually cries during the clothing changes (possibly because quite tired by that point.. ) but calms with the books. Is it OK to give hm pacifier for extra calm during the routine (but take it out when he goes in crib), or need to go full cold turkey.
- he usually cries when waking from naps - could this suggest he's still tired? Or something else?
- last feed is usually at least 30mins before goes in bed. He has some feeding aversion from reflux (now medicated) which means he'll only eat when properly hungry and often refuses feed pre bedtime which isn't helpful - but did manage to feed before bedtime last night so don't think hunger should have been an issue then",Sleep training issues - wakes after 10-20mins,1672402951.0

The consensus was that he was napping too much during the day (4.5-5.5 hours per day). We have fixed that and he is now napping 3-4 hours per day. He’s largely stopped napping 1.5-2.5 hours at a time though and almost always wakes up after 45-60 minutes. Please read my last post for full details! 😊

Anyway, he’s now in a solid habit of waking around 1am and sometimes between 3am and 5am. He goes to sleep away 7-8pm and wakes for the day around 7am. When he wakes crying in the night, I reinsert his dummy and he goes back to sleep for usually 5-10 minutes. After doing this 3 times, I accept that he is hungry and get up to feed him. He often guzzles the whole 5oz both times. 

He is having 28-35oz per day, but probably only 24oz of that is during the day. I feel like we could maybe try and feed him up a little more during the day, but I think he’s having the correct amount for his weight and age in his day time feeds.

One point to note: he’s quite congested from covid and has been for 2 weeks. He gets such a blocked nose through the night and his nose breathing is so loud. Saline spray helps marginally. 

I don’t think his wake ups were caused by his excessive day time napping now, but I’m unsure what is causing it.

Since 4.5 mo he sleeps through the night without a night feed but with the occasional putting back a paci (we dont mind and we plan to cold turkey drop the paci at night at around 10mo). We did no formal sleep training but what we did resembles a sort of pick up-put down mixed with FIO. 

Since about a week he suddenly has multiple MOTN wakings in which he just talks to himself for two hours. All very cute but he of course doesnt regulate his volume so we lie awake for two hours as well (putting back his paci doesnt work). After two hours he starts crying and wants a bottle. Its not much trouble but its out of the ordinary. He sleeps in his own crib and room since he was 4 weeks, the room is dark and more or less silent (we have some things in his room/our house that make more or less white noise type sounds). 

Could this be sleep regression? We have more issues with naptime as well. He used to go down quite easy (duration would be anywhere between 45m and 2.5 hours) and is now crying almost every time and more often than not sleeps barely 45 minutes. 

We have some issues with separation anxiety sometimes as well but I would expect him to be crying when waking up as well if that plays a roll (he is always happily talking when waking up). But could it be that?

He has no teeth yet, but I dont see any signs of teething atm (he drools a lot but he does that since he was 10 weeks…. and that’s about it). 

Schedule: wake-up is at 7am most days, he has 2.5h wake windows. First nap at 9.30. If he does one longer nap and one shorter one he does two naps, otherwise its two naps and a powernap at 16.30/17.00. Bedtime is 18.00-18.30. We have a consistent bedtime routine of diaper, pj’s, sleepsack, bottle, story, song and some cuddles, we put him down awake (it usually takes him 5-10 minutes to fall asleep). He sometimes falls asleep on the bottle, but not consistently, so we dont think he relies on the bottle to fall asleep. For naps we put him in his sleepsack and he goes in his crib awake. If his naps are on the shorter side we do crib hour. 

We didnt change a thing over the last week (other than it being christmas and we were visiting family/family was visiting us). He does eat more solids since about two weeks, but no signs of congestion or anything, so we thought having a fuller belly should mean he sleeps better, not worse 😅

She will fall asleep in your arms and then stay asleep for 2-3 hrs after being put down and wake for a feed. I’ve tried CIO and modified CIO but she gets hysterical.

She still falls asleep independently and happily for bedtime - almost never tears there. Most naps are the same but if timing is off she will struggle of course.

528,sleeptrain,"Hi all! Long time lurker of this sub and hoping for some advice.

I have a wonderful almost 5.5 month old girl (born 7/20) who has never been sleepy, even as a newborn. Currently naps max out at ~30 minutes unless in the stroller or car (or if I rock her for 10 minutes after one sleep cycle into another during a contact nap). Up until a week ago she was doing 
nights in a side sleeper bassinet with bedtime ~7:30-8:15pm and wake-up 7-7:30, but with MANY night wakes. She would frequently false start and even on “good” nights she was averaging 3 wakes to nurse, often more. There were, however, 4 days in a row (~2 weeks ago) where I put her down completely awake and left the room and she got herself to sleep with no crying, but this hasn’t happened again since being moved to her own room/crib. Now that she is in her own crib she’s had a few nights with false starts, a few without, and bedtime is typically between 7:30 and 8 with wake up between 6:45 and 7:15. She’s waking at ~11pm, 2am, and 5am for feeds. For a couple weeks she was giving us longer first stretches of ~5 hours so I don’t think that 11pm wake up is necessarily hunger. 

We’ve just moved to a 2/2.5/2.5/3 from a 2/2.25/2.5/2.5/2.75. First and third nap we rock to sleep and transfer her to her crib and these average 30 minutes. To ensure enough day sleep we do second nap in the stroller and average 1.5 hours, sometimes a little more or little less. Moved to the longer last WW when baby started arching back, doing baby crunches when attempting to rock her which has typically been our sign that she’s undertired, although I’m just not sure!

Baby is EBF but husband does the first night feed with a bottle. It had been great to pause pumping when it seemed like she dropped that first feed but, alas :,). Last feed is finished 30 minutes before bedtime and routine after nursing is lotion, diaper, PJs, sleep sack, books. I still try to give her an opportunity to put herself down each night so will target putting her fully awake in her crib ~5 minutes before end of WW, telling her I love her and to sleep well, and leaving. I’ll then go downstairs to get ready for bed (with the monitor) and give her ~5 minutes to settle. As mentioned previously, prior to moving her to her crib this had resulted in a number of nights where she put herself down (though she does have a paci - I think we’ll need to get rid of it when we ST) and other nights where I could come back and settle her by hand on chest and shushing. Now it’s crying almost immediately and I always end up rocking her, which is why I am wondering if her last WW is too long.

Lots of info but essentially i’m wondering if our schedule makes sense and is setting us up for success. Not worrying about naps right now, but interested to know if 2.5 is enough day sleep.

529,sleeptrain,"Hey guys! I have a two year old (29 months) and a 9 month old baby, and my toddler has been having a lot of issues going to bed.

She was a great sleeper as a baby (sleep trained at 7 months) and also as a toddler up until the point where we moved her to a bed. At first she was fine in bed, but recently she’s started getting up when we’re trying to put her down for the night, and it’s taking 1+ hours to put her down every night. Pretty sure it’s turned into a game for her. She also will get up at least once at night (somewhere between 1 and 3am), wanting us to tuck her back in. Some nights this motn wakes take multiple tries to get her to go back to sleep, and every once in a while my husband or I end up just sleeping in her bed with her because we’re so exhausted.

Her schedule is, on paper:

- up at 6:30

- nap from 12-2

- bed at 7

However her nap times have varied a lot lately, with some days her ending up sleeping until 3 (which I’m guessing is not great), and at night she’s rarely asleep before 8. So she’s been getting around 12 hours of sleep total, which makes it so confusing to me as to why she’s giving us so much trouble at bedtime; I’d think she should be tired.

Once back to healthy we had a trip where we had to cosleep as well and finally we’re back home and about 3 weeks ago we started doing the Ferber again.

532,sleeptrain,"My baby sleeps through the night with a few wakeups - more so now that she’s teething and going thru the regression phase. I feel like this is partially my fault as well as we don’t necessarily have a bed time routine, it’s weird but we never needed one. Baby sleeps in crib during the day, takes shit naps (30 min and sometimes as much as 10 min) but co-sleeps with us. Somehow she’s just always knew that when she’s in bed it’s sleep time and nap time is for short sleep. 

3 times now since she’s turned four months, she continues sleeping through her last nap (4pm). I’m fairly certain that shes confusing it for her sleep and not just a long nap because she wakes up reluctantly after about 2 hours and cries until we get into bed. Today she did it again. She slept rfrom 3-5 in the ergo carrier while we were on a walk and then reluctantly woke up. Her eyes were red, she was fussing immediately after getting out, rubbing her face and about to cry. I changed her and fed her a bit and tried to pacify her, but by 6 pm she was screaming for bed and went to sleep with me without much of a fight. 

I don’t get it. That was supposed to be her largest wake window of the day so she can sleep for bed. Now I don’t know how the night will go. She must be confusing the last nap for her sleep, but I have no clue why. I 100% don’t want her bedtime to be 4/5pm, that’s for sure. How do I go about this??

I feel it’s important to add this was all after her sleep regression began, she started waking up more at night with me so I tried to put her in her crib overnight, thinking she wanted space. But she had 3 crappy nights and very cranky days and I was afraid of ruining her amazing night sleeps so I moved her back to the bed. I just want to fix it so she’s not screaming everyday before bedtime because she’s still tired from the nap that never ends

UPDATE: I wanted to update this post because I got a lot of good advice that made a lot of sense, and because a miracle happened today it may help someone else that’s going through the same thing I am. 

This morning my baby woke up at 6:50 am, almost 13 hours of sleep (she definitely fell asleep at 6 because I looked at the time) which led me to believe that you guys are right, she’s clearly not maxing out her sleep. I  decided to change the long nap (she sleeps longest guaranteed in the ergo) to her 2nd nap instead of last. We went out about 11:30 this morning and she slept til 1. 
BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED!
Yesterday was a really rough one for us. This morning when she was fighting her first nap, I felt myself getting frustrated. I took a step back, but kept replacing her paci when she spit it out. I was also talking to my SO and we were having a conversation so she could hear us but not see us. Somehow, between the 3rd and 4th paci replacement, she … fell asleep. Lol. On her own. 

AND THEN SHE DID IT AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND RIGHT NOW AS IM WRITING THIS POST!!

I can’t say if this will stick, or if this is a one-off and I need to play the lottery today, but I think I just realized the visual of me is just way too stimulating in the day time. (Her room is dark but gets enough light to see me) To be clear, I did not CIO. She never cried. No judgement, just want to clarify. She whined a little while she was fighting it but that was it. I soothed her with the paci and one time with food, quickly, and then I moved away again. I know this is dramatic, but this is the best day ever and I consider it a late Christmas gift from the universe. It did NOT change her nap times, but I’m hoping as she gets more comfortable she’ll better be able to bridge sleep cycles. Right now I’m just taking this as a win.

533,sleeptrain,"Hi! My son is about to turn 7 months old. We started sleep training for nights with extinction about three weeks ago,  and it's gone fairly well. We're at less than 15 minutes of crying at bedtime and after night feeds (1-2 per night), typically 5-10 minutes each wake. We did full extinction because our baby gets hooked on being held and just gets more mad if we're in the room but not holding him. 

We have not done naps. For naps, we have a short routine (diaper, sleepsack, dark room and white noise, song) and rock to sleep. If we put him in his crib,  we usually get a short nap (around 40 mimutes), though there have been some fluke meaty naps. If we were going to be home all the time,  now would be the time to do naps,  but he's a daycare baby.

We are currently on a two-week break from daycare. When he goes back a week from Monday,  he'll be in daycare M-Th and  at home F-Su. So far he's been having crap naps, 30 minutes once or twice a day at variable times, at daycare. I don't think they can let him cry very long in his crib without disturbing other babies, and it seems like he's in a FOMO phase where he fusses before going to sleep.

I'm wondering what experiences people have had with nap training and daycare. Is it worth it? Did your kid adapt to different routines at daycare and at home? We can handle the growing pains of nap training, but if we're likely to have to restart every week that doesn't seem feasible. 

ICYI, here's our desired schedule.  Wake up times have been variable but we don't turn on lights and start the day before 6. We're on about a 2.5/3/3.5 wake  window. We are consistent with the 7pm bedtime unless he didn't nap and us clearly overtired.

Wake up: 7am
Nap 1: 9:30 (variable length)
Nap 2: 1ish, depending on Nap 1
Nap 3: short (less than 30 minutes) between 4-5 depending on Nap 2, often skipped
Last feed: 6:30, bedtime routine begins after last feed (diaper/pajamas, two books, song, in bed awake) 
Bedtime: 7pm

He did not respond to Ferber at 3 months as the check-ins just made him mad. Baby is almost 8 months, and though he falls asleep fine, he still wakes 2-3 times overnight to feed.

we’ve had two nights on the mattress. he’s fallen asleep in the middle of our bedtime routine, so i’ve been transferring him to mattress. first night he woke up around 1 and tantrumed from 1-3am, refused to sleep on mattress or in bed with me and we ended up on the couch.

second night, he woke up at 11 and same story, but he did fall asleep in bed with me.

i hate bedsharing and am super anal about the safety aspect of it, so that’s not a longterm option. we’ve done several rounds of failed ferber and two semi-successful CIOs in the past. i have no problem with extended crying but now he pukes when he gets really wound up, so that’s out.

while i can apparently get him TO sleep, i can’t KEEP him sleeping - he has always had multiple MOTN wakeups and is only sometimes able to put himself back to bed. with free range now, i’m not sure how that’ll work.

Anyway, I am not opposed to CIO if that is going to be the fastest way to establish good sleep. My question is, for traditional CIO, do we let him cry for every night waking (other than his one MOTN feed)? Or CIO for bedtime and then night wakings set a time before checking in?

Our LO (8 weeks, 5 week's adjusted) was on a solid schedule for two weeks :

730AM: Wake, feed, play until 9AM
9AM: Feed
10-12AM: Nap
1PM-3PM: Nap
4PM-530PM: Nap
630PM-8PM: Nap 
8PM: Bath, swaddle, quiet time,
830PM: Feed
9PM: Sleep

In the past two weeks, two things happened: 

She started being extremely fussy anytime she's not asleep or feeding. She basically acts overtired all the time. To limit cries and make sure she naps enough, we started helping her nap more... But she still fights these naps : She''ll only sleep if she is patted/rocked/white noise, even in our arms. We wake her up at the end of each nap period. 

The second thing is that she still does a great shift from 9PM to 130AM... But then refuses to do the second one. Either screaming bloody murder when laid down, or waking after 30 minutes. So we hold her asleep in our arms until second MOTN feed, and then she falls back asleep in her Snoo. 

My questions for you all are:
1)  Are we wrong to strong-arm her into doing full and regular naps? Is she sleeping too much? But if so why does she look so tired and grumpy all the time? And if she's undertired, why is the first night sleep so good? 
2) Should we move her to an earlier bedtime? She shows patterns of day/night consolidation, but with her born at 37 weeks we're really not sure if we should consider she's 8 or 5 WO...

So, my LO is 4months old (18weeks). I think that we hit the regression, he used to give us 5-6, sometimes 7hour stretches at night in the snoo. Lately 4hour stretch is a win, tonight he woke up every 1-1.5h hours. During this time we moved him from 4 to 3 naps, because he was fighting 4th nap like hell.

Since dropping the nap, he goes to bed around 8pm wakes up around 7am (used to wake up around 6am). Naps are crappy, 45mins, i extend second nap by nursing him and then doing contact nap for 1h30min-2h. Last wake window is 2h30-3hours. 

He used to nurse to sleep, then we moved nursing 30mins before bedtime and now rock him to sleep. He was doing great, even managed to soothe him, put him in the snoo and it would soothe him to sleep. Well, no more. Yesterday poor baby was screaming unconsolable, tried rocking, shushing, singing, bouncing on yoga ball, i tried, my husband tried. Then i tried nursing him, he ate for a bit, released the boobie and back to crying, husband finally rocked him to sleep. Well, then he was up every hour or hour and a half, and he wasnt hungry, as he would munch a little bit, then release the boob and fuss. I had to rock him to sleep every time, but he would be very fussy at first. Like what the hell dude.

We tried FIO a few times, but im not sure if we were doing it right, we would do bedtime routine, put him in a merlin suit or snoo sack with one arm out, white noise, dark room, put him in the snoo on baseline and leave him for 15mins.

I am having trouble getting her on a schedule, and her naps have sort of regressed in that she has trouble sleeping during the day and we have been resorting to contact naps as a result. She wakes around 720 and her first nap is around 9/915 pretty consistently. The rest of the schedule for the day depends on how long or short this nap is, and it’s variable.

I will go about 2 hours from when she wakes to her second nap of the day. Usually it’s between 12 and 1. This nap is a big question mark and also quite variable, and therefore so is the timing of her final nap of the day. On average it’s about an hour.

We tuck him in his bed and leave the room he follows us back. Or cries and wakes up his little sister who sleeps in the same room in the cot. 

We let him sleep while we are in his room and we leave the room, he comes into our room as soon as he’s through a sleep cycle. This is usually within 1-2 hours max.

573,sleeptrain,"I saw a post kind of like this but I have the reverse problem. My 3 month old is a champion bad napper. I realize that is developmentally appropriate and when my daughter went through it we implemented all kinds of things - nap routine, lots of rocking, holding, soothing, two-part naps where we would hold and rock her in a dark room to prolong the short naps until she was better able to connect her sleep cycles. But right now, I have a toddler who does NOT want to wait any amount of time for me to put her brother down. I generally let her chill in the living room with a show or something (it's childproofed and we have a gate) while I put her brother down upstairs, but I don't have just all the time in the world to get him down. I am not comfortable leaving her alone in her playroom for more than about 5ish minutes.

Right now he is napping like 15-20 minutes unless he gets a LOT OF very quiet and dark wind down time upstairs (the pack and play on the first floor just doesn't work, his sister is on a screaming jag and the second I get him down she screams and yells for crackers or something until he wakes up. He HAS TO nap upstairs, we can work on the rest later but right now he is so overtired I am prioritizing getting him sleep however he will do it).

When he does wake up from these little 10ish minute naps, the only thing that gets him back down is more of the same and contact napping in a quiet, dark room. I can't just leave my toddler alone while I do that, but if I take her with me she wants to snuggle the baby, she chatters a bunch, she gets jealous and screams for my attention which wakes the baby. She is not the kind of kid you can set up with a quiet activity like coloring or whatever and get 10 minutes. She is nonstop and one of the behaviors she's developed as she adjusts to the new baby is screaming. She's realized we really don't want her to do it because it wakes her brother and so the second I pay too much attention to the baby or her dad, she screams. We are working on it but it's super slow going.

Before you suggest it, he hates being baby worn. He really really hates it. I don't know why, my daughter loved it, but this kid does not. I have tried introducing various wraps and carriers over and over again and he just really does not like them, which is stressful on its own because I am not great at getting the wraps right and if he's screaming and she's screaming it's just not a good experience.

576,sleeptrain,"Hi there,
We just began sleep training last night with the CIO full extinction method. We have tried quite a few different ways and had to settle on this as a last resort because we have a strong-willed child who is aggravated with receiving check-ins. 

Anyhoo, he has a regular and consistent nap and bedtime regiment so we thought it would be a good time to start sleep training. Last night was our first night using CIO he cried a bit then for the rest of the night (10 out of 11 hours) that he was in bed he sat up fighting his sleep. He eventually collapsed at one point at 2 am and slept soundly for about 45 minutes then woke up got into sitting position and started fighting his sleep all over again all over again. During the sitting session he does not cry. He also does know how to lay down. We have worked with him on this and he does it on any surface except his crib. I went in at 4 am to feed and change his diaper (he needed both of those things) and when I put him back down he stood and cried for two additional hours before we just decided to bring him into the bed to get some rest since he slept only 45 minutes all night long (7pm-6am). 

Has anyone experienced anything like this and if so what did you do? We are doing our best to give him space to figure things out, but this isn’t something we anticipated. 

Any pointers will be helpful! Thank you!

He wakes at 7:30 am we do a nursing session and book from 7:30-8 am, diaper change brush teeth and multivitamin until 8:30 then I offer him solids for breakfast. He does a contact nap for his first nap between 9:30 am and 10. He usually sleeps 1-1.5 hours the rest of the day varies with what sort of play he engages in based on how the workday goes. Then he has a second nap that is usually 1-2 hours typically around 1 or 2pm.

577,sleeptrain,"I randomly decided to sleeptrain our almost 6-month-old baby for naps on Christmas day, and it has been a success. She's been sleeptrained for nighttime sleep already when she was between 4.5 to 5 months, and she sleeps between 10.5 to 12 hours every night without waking up. Sometimes she will fuss for a few minutes between sleep cycles in the night, but she always falls back asleep within 10 minutes without us having to intervene.

NIGHTTIME: We used a modified version of the Ferber method. At nighttime, my husband puts her to sleep for 10 minutes and puts her down once she is fully asleep. When we sleeptrained, she was waking up several times in the night, so we went in every 5 minutes the first night. That took about 35 minutes. The next night, we would go in after 10 minutes, and she fell asleep before the 20-minute mark. Then she started rolling onto her tummy in her sleep and being unable to roll back onto her back. That derailed sleeptraining for WEEKS. It took at least a month because she would roll over and be inconsolable until she was flipped onto her back, only to instinctively roll back onto her tummy at some point. This would sometimes go on all night, or she would just sleep through the night without rolling over. Then she started to sleep on her tummy on some nights for a few hours, and now she can roll both ways in her sleep. Despite that rolling debacle, she is now fully sleeptrained. My husband still puts her to sleep with a pacifier by holding her for about 10 minutes every night, and she stays asleep until the morning. She rolls around so much in her sleep that sometimes we find that she's done a complete 180-degree turn by the morning.

NAPTIME: We used to only do contact naps and relied heavily on pacifiers to put her to sleep. Then on Christmas morning, I just decided that it was time for her to nap on her own. The first nap, we went in every 5 minutes after putting her down drowsy but awake. She fell asleep after 35 minutes. Then she took about 10 minutes during her next nap, and about 5 minutes the next nap. We thought this went well until the next day. It took about 20 minutes the first nap. I was confused because she was doing worse than the day before. Then when we put her down for her next nap, she cried for 10 minutes, and I felt like she wasn't ready to sleep even though she seemed tired and fussy before we put her down. So I got her back up and put her down after another 15 minutes or so, when she got fussy again. She cried for 5 minutes without being able to fall asleep, so I started shushing and patting her butt (she's a tummy sleeper). She fell asleep within a minute. After that, I would put her in her crib and shush and pat her butt for 2 minutes when it was time for her to nap. She cries or fusses for about a minute, then clonks out every time. She doesn't need a pacifier anymore. I've read that even after sleeptraining, a lot of babies take about 10 minutes to fall asleep for naps. It may not work for all babies, but patting her butt and shushing her seem to put her to sleep within 2 minutes every time.

So I thought I'd share what worked for us. Oh and yesterday, I was watching her on the nannycam and saw that she got up after 30 minutes without making a sound for a few minutes and actually put herself back to sleep. This has never happened before, and it was incredible. She naps longer now (not every time but she takes at least one nap a day that lasts longer than an hour), and she is happier overall when she is awake. She used to be on a 4-nap schedule, and she has moved onto a 3-nap schedule all by herself yesterday by staying awake longer and taking longer naps.


Also if you find that your baby wakes up super early all of a sudden, try feeding her again right before she goes to bed. Ours got up at 5-5:30am one day, and we could not seem to break out of that cycle for a while. I realized that it was because she sleeps for about 11.5 hours from the last feeding of the night. Now she makes it to 6am, which is a huge improvement though it is still pretty early. Give the baby a bottle, not solids, right before bed. Solids don't keep her full enough.

Here's his current schedule roughly drawn out:

* 6AM: Wake for the day (this varies weekday vs weekend. Weekend this is closer to 7:30)
* 9AM: 2 hour nap
* 1PM: 2 hour nap
* 6PM: Bedtime routine (usually put down around 6:45PM)
* 9PM: ""Dream feed""
* 11:30PM: First night-time wake
* 3:30AM: Second night-time wake

What we're hoping to do is eliminate both, or at least one of those two night-time wakings.

Our son is able to fall asleep unassisted on his own. His crib is still located in our room. He'll complain and talk to himself for 5-10 minutes and typically fall asleep. This is true both in the evenings and during naps. We don't rock him, give him a pacifier, anything like that. For naps, when we see his tired signs we just put him into his crib and let him go to sleep for naps. His bedtime routine starts at 6pm. We had been bathing him, reading him a book or two, and then my wife was breast feeding him right before putting him down. We've recently changed that process to feeding him, then bathing, then reading him a book before putting him down. He accepted this change without issue.

When he wakes at night he usually starts crying right away. We *had* been very good a few months ago about trying to put a hand on him, shush him, rock him, etc before giving up and feeding him. However, he started daycare at about 5 months and all of us have been sick so often that we kind of gave up on this to just feed him when he asked for it. I would say his sleep has regressed, as there was a period a few months ago where he had only one night-time waking.

My working theory is that he's possibly getting too much sleep during his day-time naps. As far as how to break the night-time feedings, I'm less sure.

Schedule is aprox 2.5/2.5/2.5/2.5 with the last window sometimes being shortened to keep consistent bedtime and capping the last nap to as little at 15 mins. 

The past two days he has woken immediately after falling asleep for the first nap but I have been able to get him back down. But it has also gone from being 1-1.75 hrs to 20-30 mins. Yesterday I wasn’t able to extend but today I was. He wakes up scream crying. Is this undertiredness? I tried doing closer to 2.75 this morning and same thing.

Have never posted but have learned so much here. I’ve been reading and searching for answers and could really use some thoughts from this group. 

Our baby is 11 months old and has always been an early riser. For a long time, that meant 5 or 5:30, sometimes 6am if we were lucky. For the past few weeks, that has meant anywhere between 3:30 and 4:45 am.

Around 9 months we worked hard to shift bedtime from 6pm/6:30pm to 7pm and peg his first nap at 9am in hopes that it would shift wake time (and lengthen unpredictable naps). We had such a good stretch of long naps and 6am wake ups! Now we are floundering with a return to very early mornings and still unpredictable naps. 


More info:

- Our ideal schedule is 6am rise, 9-10am nap, 1:30/2-3pm nap, 7pm bedtime. (Approximately 3/3.5/4 wake windows)

- We live in a one bedroom and baby sleeps in our room. We always give baby at least 15 mins after waking in the morning to see if he goes back to sleep. Sometimes he then is quiet, but definitely not really going back to sleep for chunks of time. It is hard to give him much longer than 15 minutes to fuss because we can’t sleep!

- We do crib hour for all naps. This has been the only way we broke the constant 35 minute nap habit he had formed by around 6 months. It has been somewhat successful, but naps are still inconsistent. Can range from 35 mins to 1.5 hours. I don’t cap naps because I worry that he is simply not getting enough sleep, and honestly the short naps are super difficult for us in terms of needing a break! He is usually fussy for the rest of that hour if he does wake early, but never extremely upset. 

- Baby has always had lower sleep needs. Yet on the days he sleeps 9 hours overnight and naps for 1 hour total, he isn’t very happy…which to me says that he does need a bit more sleep.

- Independent sleep with no feedings at night. Bottle half an hour before each nap and bedtime, solids an hour before that with good protein. (Sometimes he is now just completely zonking out with the bottle as we are trying to keep him up longer. It is so sad…I’m really lost here). 

- Room is very very dark with a sound machine plus a room divider between our bed and the crib.



Should we…?

A) Try a MUCH earlier bedtime? Pushing bedtime up by a 1/2 hour or hour seems to only get us an even earlier wake time. Are we not moving bedtime up early enough? In the past we had some success with a temporary 5:30pm bedtime to help him sleep in a bit. Now, I’m so afraid to try it again as he seems to just be sleeping 9 hours from bedtime. 

B) Try a later bedtime? I’m wondering if he just doesn’t need quite as much sleep as we are hoping for. 

C) Adjust the nap schedule with the early wakes? Is it awful to keep forcing the 9am nap when it is so difficult for him? 

D) Just stay the course a bit longer with this schedule and hope the adjustment happens?  (We’ve been trying to stick to that 9am nap for about 3-4 days now).",Bedtime and early wake-up,1672238275.0

SOS!!!.
Hi all. I'm a first time mum to a beautiful 6mo baby girl and I need help! 👋

I feel like I have seriously failed the sleep thing. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

I am currently trying day naps in her cot and will be transferring to the cot at night soon too (waiting for our WiFi to be switched on at our new house to use our monitor).

During the day, I am following ""wake windows' of 2hrs which is about when she starts to get cranky. I will still only get 30 min naps out of her. I imagine this is partly because she cannot link sleep cycles. I just usually cannot get her back to sleep unless I pick her up snd we contact nap - forget putting her back into the bed. She cries. But if I was to lay in my bed with her, she'd sleep for at least an hour.

Wake time is usually around 830am. 

She gets put to bed around 9-930pm but will wake every 30min-2hr or so to be resettled back to sleep. This either looks like replacing her dummy and/or holding hand. As a last resort, I pick her up and cuddle her back to sleep. 

Around 6am she wakes again and I usually take her into bed with me where she will sleep uninterrupted until 830am. I really never wanted to do the co sleep thing but out of sheer desperation and need for unbroken sleep, this is what's happening :( 

Feeds during the day are around every 3 hours. She's breastfed and having purees twice a day. 

We are using white noise and a sleep sack and thats about it. No other sleep aides. 

We reluctantly tried the Ferber method for one night but she ended up not settling and crying so hard she completely woke up and struggled to settle her. I really don't want to do any form of CIO if we can avoid it.

Can someone please help me? I really don't know what I'm doing wrong.

In the last several weeks, she’s had a massive burst of energy before bedtime. She wants to PLAY. She’ll go to sleep for me most nights (I still BF as part of her routine 5/7 nights per week) but bedtime with my husband is much trickier. We end up “giving in” and I put her to sleep about half of the time he’s supposed to. 

She has also been having MOTN wakings. These used to be pretty infrequent (once every other week) and have started to happen more often than not. If we try to get her back to bed in her crib she screams, rolls off our laps, runs around the house. She’s WIDE awake by that time and it can take two hours to get her back to sleep. The one thing we CAN do is bring her into our bed, I BF and she’ll fall asleep in minutes. 

I’m not so upset at the co-sleeping, that’s fine. She’s a toddler. But the wakings combined with the energy boost have me scratching my head.  She’s also been napping for shorter times (sometimes only 1.5 hours instead of 3) and that makes her grumpy and overtired by EOD.

That said, she's gone through a language explosion the past few days along with an increased desire to try walking when, previously, she was content with her usual scooting. She also goes down for naps and bedtime with ease, still, and when she wakes after those 35 minutes, she's still tired and will often nestle in to try continuing the nap on the person who picks her up.

UPDATE: I wanted to thank you all for your support and advice. I’m pretty sure the issue was separation anxiety.

She did wake and stand/cry that same night at 3am but we gave her about 5 mins and again she sat down and went to sleep. Since then we’ve only had minimal fussing.

My 11 month old has generally been an excellent sleeper—we’ve had blips but for the most part it’s been good. Now things have gone haywire and I don’t even know where to begin. Basically she now hates going down in the crib for all sleep (literally never been an issue). I place her down and she immediately stands up and screams and screams. Standing isn’t new but she did just recently learn that she can in her crib (she also wears a Woolino to sleep) so I’m not sure if that’s the issue. I read that sitting next to the crib might help encourage her to lower herself but that doesn’t work as the crib sides are an opaque mesh. I also tried putting her back down repeatedly but that seemed to just make her angrier. 

Her wake windows currently are 3/3.5/4 which have seemed good for preventing overtiredness while building enough sleep pressure. I will say those wake times have been longer the last few days because it takes me so long to get her to sleep so I’m sure she’s currently overtired. Ugh, everything is a mess!

628,sleeptrain,"My daughter just turned 7 months on Christmas, and I'm trying to figure out when I should be dropping the third nap, for only two. Her usual wake windows are usually 1.58 /2.13, ( depending how grumpy/ tired she is in the morning ) for the second, 2.20, and the last wake window before her third nap is 2.20 mins. She's awake for about 3 hrs before bedtime, usually around 7:00/7:40. And her wake time is like clockwork 7:20/7:40 am, with a nap time around 9:30. I usually cap the first nap about 1.15 mins in ( so she doesn't sleep too late into the morning .) her second nap is usually around 45 mins, sometimes I'll cap it at 45 mins as well, and her last nap is usually the shortest, I don't cap it, but usually it varies from 20/30 mins. Recently her last nap has been the shortest. The reason as well to me capping her naps, is we moved over a month ago and I've been trying to get her sleeping schedule back on track, which it's been going well, and I don't want her last nap to run to late into 5pm ish, because that's when I feed her solids and get her ready for a bath. I've recently noticed her wake windows have become increasingly shorter, about 2.20 hrs is when I'm starting to notice her become more grumpy/ red eyes/ rubbing eyes/ when it used to be closer to 2.40/3hrs. She has become more active with rolling over and trying to crawl, so I'm thinking she's wearing herself out more from constantly rolling and moving around, and she's been moody more because of teething. Should I try to keep her up longer? Try to push for 2.40/3 hrs again ? Or stay with the same schedule. It seems to be working out, but I was told babies at her age should be taking 2 naps. I'm kind of stuck on what to do about it, cause she's usually dead tired on the first nap, the second if I get her down at exactly 2.20 mins she'll fight me, and settling in my arms for 10 mins before  falling asleep, she'll act tired or grumpy so I'll just get her to nap earlier. But should I keep her up longer after her first nap, so her second nap is way longer ? Cause my problem is making sure her last nap doesn't run to late into the evening, but if she's trying to drop a nap, I want to make sure the second one doesn't end too early in the day to where she's up way toooo long before bed, cause that's happened before, and caused false wakes. 

Edit: her first nap started 20 mins earlier, since she was acting extremely grumpy and had back to back wakings last night, so I put her down early, at 1.58 hrs of her being awake. I've noticed as well, if she isn't hungry before bed, she wakes at 11am to eat, sometimes not even hungry just needing to resettle or she's teething, she'll wake again at 4am to eat, again at 6am to resettle and then up for the day at 7am.

629,sleeptrain,"Hi all. I have a 2y3mo old child who was trained using Ferber. We never got to the point of truly sleeping through the night. On an average night, he goes to bed at 8:00 p.m., wakes up around midnight and just needs a quick pat on the back comfort to fall back asleep, wakes again around 4:00 a.m. needing milk and then goes back to sleep, and then wakes at 6:30 for the day.

Nap is usually noon - 2pm. 

Lately however he's been waking up five or six times in the night, sometimes he wants milk, sometimes he wants to play, he doesn't seem like he's teething or in pain. Last night was awful, he was awake every 15 minutes from 2:00 to 6:00 just not wanting to sleep I guess. Most days he's waking up at 5:30 or 5:45 for the day.

We have an okay to wake clock but he doesn't seem to care about it. He knows that green means morning time, but if it's still red it doesn't stop him from crying or fussing for our attention.

He's still in his crib, sleeps in his own room.

It seems like the moment he wakes up in the middle of the night he cries or fusses even if he doesn't need anything. I've seen him sort of half wake up, reposition himself, and fall back asleep - so I know he can do that, it just seems like he doesn't most of the time. I also think that he's starting to sign for milk as an excuse to get out of his room, not that he actually wants milk as often as he's requesting it.

The feedings are 10mins and she goes right back down without even needing a pacifier, soemtimes she'd wake and fuss but go back to sleep in 5-10min.

Now this week something changed. Day time routine is the same except that she dropped one small nap, she goes down easily for naps. But at night she started waking and fussing every two hours or so. She's not hungry, seems like she wakes up and is not able to go back to sleep. I try to let her fuss it out like she used to but it barely ever works, she needs to be given a pacifier, only once or twice in a night it's hunger.

642,sleeptrain,"\[EDIT 12/27 to add this note: **There is zero need to get anxious about ""baby is not getting enough sleep"".** I read up on the literature around sleep and development (medical researcher myself). While there is physiologic basis to suspect that good sleep -> better development, the evidence is quite slight and biology is so powerful that the vast majority of babies/parents are probably getting enough sleep for normal development. More consolidated sleep/normal schedule are great for parental wellbeing, and parental wellbeing is super important, but there is zero need to feel guilty as a parent if your baby isn't doing those AND you are okay with its effect on your lifestyle and still able to function the way you want to. However, if you are getting too tired/burnt out by your baby's sleep patterns, understanding his/her sleep requirement may help you get him/her on pattern that enables you to function better.\]

So I've been on this sub for a while now and learning a lot from everyone. One recurrent thing that is almost behind every post I see: is my baby getting too much or not enough sleep?

In troubleshooting every sleep issue with my own baby, the most useful piece of info that I have uncovered is my own baby's sleep requirement. I can say pretty comfortably now that my almost 8mo's sleep requirement is about 13.5-14 hours a day, and has been around that since 4 months. It doesn't matter to me if the AVERAGE baby is sleeping 13 hours around this age: I know he is maximally happy with 13.5-14 hours. Knowing this has made figuring out his schedule SO MUCH easier, because I know his total wake time needs to be 10-10.5 hours, BUT if he had a few days where he didn't get 13.5-14 hours I'd need to catch him up and let him sleep a bit more. So I just wanted to share some observations that I made while uncovering that piece of info.

**To uncover the info, I took a week where I thought my baby is getting enough sleep and averaged the daily sleep over that week.** And then I applied extrapolation based on the following:

\-babies sleep the most in the first 2 months, then sleep requirement decreases by about 1 hour between month 3 and month 12 ([https://parentingscience.com/baby-sleep-chart/](https://parentingscience.com/baby-sleep-chart/)) -- however, babies stay in their percentile, which means that a high sleep-needs newborn sleeping 17 hours a day will in all likelihood need 16 hours at 6 months

\-while reading about averages in the chart above, realize that those are averages of how much babies are sleeping, not how much sleep they need - it is very difficult to make anyone, babies or not, sleep more than they need, but it is easy to make a baby not sleep enough, therefore the amount of sleep babies need is probably higher than the average amount slept that babies are getting

**Five criteria to tell if baby is getting enough sleep**

1. Stable schedule that doesn't vary a ton from day to day (consistent wake up time and bedtime, roughly consistent amount of day sleep and night sleep);
2. Easy to settle at nap time (<10 minutes) and at bedtime (<20 minutes);
3. Good night sleep with a long, continuous stretch of sleep where wakings are very brief, don't require resettling, or only requiring a night feed if age appropriate;
4. Baby stays awake on stroller rides, car rides, and during feeding (unless it's at the very end of their wake windows);
5. Baby and caregivers are all happy with the schedule. A happy baby is energetic, calm, eats well, and poops well.

Stability is the most important criteria. This is because a hallmark of overtiredness/chronic sleep deprivation is bad nights interspersed with a good night/day here and there, the ""crash"" night/day where the baby is so exhausted he/she crashes for a 12/24-hour segment and has the edge taken off just enough that he/she is ready to be unsettled again. During the ""crash"" night/day his/her sleep duration may be higher than his/her actual sleep requirement.

**What if there never seems to be a good week?**

Then it is probably safe to assume that your baby is NOT getting enough sleep, and address the main reasons:

1. a schedule that doesn't allow for enough sleep (e.g. wake window too long OR too many naps/wake windows) or has sleep in the wrong places (e.g. not enough time for night sleep \[time between bedtime and out of crib time\])
2. sleep association (having a parent-led sleep association and not being able to fall asleep or connect cycles independently)
3. psychological needs in older babies / toddlers (e.g. anxiety, fear, boundary testing)
4. insufficient caloric intake during the day
5. inappropriate sleep environment (temperature, sleep wear, light exposure, noise)
6. medical illness (e.g. sleep apnea, reflux)
7. disruptors, e.g. developmental milestones (last weeks), teething (usually no more than a few days)",Troubleshooting Schedule 101: Figuring out your baby's sleep requirement,1672116683.0

She’s been this way since she was 2 months old). I’d prefer her bedtime to be 7-8 pm but currently struggling with her naps in general. She’s also started teething recently, so that’s been affecting her. She’s drooling all over herself and biting on our fingers every chance she gets. 

But she’s always been a shitty napper. 30-40 s minutes religiously, except one day she slept for an hour and a half and i have no idea what I did differently. 

My question is basically the title. I’m desperate for her to get a little better sleep during the day. I follow wake windows and I’ve tried putting her to sleep earlier (75-90 min) and later 2-2 and a half hours. Right now she falls asleep pretty well and falls asleep ok between the 2/2 half hour window. 

The problem is she fights her sleep. I don’t like to feel like I’m trying for force her to sleep. But she fights it at the 2 hour window window mark as well - and sometimes I feel she’s overtired because she’ll cry and turn red right before she falls out.

If we cap naps baby is often very fussy for the following wake window which is exhausting.

What can a wake window routine look like?

I do not know anything at all. Yesterday first time learned about active sleep and now dealing with wake windows. But there is too much Information when I Google. It confuses me. 

I have handled every day anew without a big ""routine"". 

Of course I know a real routine is not possible until 3 months, but I would like to follow the ""wake windows"". 

Apparently I have tried to get him to sleep way too many times or probably kept him too awake at times, thinking he was awake even though he was still asleep.

There is a lot of information out there and I am confused.

Is there any way to summarize for me what is the most important thing to know about sleep. Especially from 8 weeks on. How do i optimize sleep?

What does an average day and night look like?

What are wake windows? What if he sleeps at meal but is awake afterwards does the time still count from feeding? 

If he is awake during the day after eating but goes back to sleep at night is that ok? (I think I always fed him even though he wasn't really awake, so as I said I didn't know about active sleep, and there is that thing called dream fed
I think because I did not know active sleep I did that the whole night. Fed him when he did not needed it, he slept, drank little, felt asleep again after or during feeding).


How long can a baby be awake from 8 weeks?

How many naps should there be?

What in general is important now from 2 months of life?

Can I wait at night until he is really awake and maybe crying (because I just did not see tonight the difference between active sleep and he is asleep, so I was asking if I should wait one time, Dont try to look for Hunger cues and wait till he really crys because of hunger
But I feel bad really fast if I wait till he cries. I am too fast trying everything, I think.) 

And I would like to establish a little ""routine"". What can I do in the morning so that he realizes yes now it is morning. And what to do in the evening? Is that even possible?

And (stupid question), can it be that he wakes up and is not hungry at all, but just awake or is he not old enough for that yet?

Should I continue with her one night feed during ST?

It hasn’t always been an issue, but I’d say the last 4-6 weeks he just will not stay asleep in his cot. He is still tired and wanting to sleep, but only in our arms or our bed. 

For the most part he has 1 night feed around 12-1am and we try to avoid any more because he’s very prone to reverse cycling. He’s also getting around 750-850ml’s and 2-3 solids a day, so hunger shouldn’t be the issue.. although if we caved and fed him at 4am it is the only way to guarantee he would go back to sleep in his cot.

My LG is currently on 2.5/3/3ish. I aim for 3 hours day sleep. She sleeps through the night but the last few days she's been a bit all over the place.

 ----


Scenario:

Toddler was previously independently sleeping through the night. Now, they refuse to sleep without a parent present. Or they are waking up extremely early, screaming/crying to be picked up. Efforts to leave toddler to settle results in prolonged crying or trying to climb the cot. Sometimes naptimes and bedtimes are also being resisted. Maybe you're now sleeping in the same room as your child or you've brought them into bed in an effort to calm them down.

If you don't think the resistance is related to schedule/too much sleep, boundary testing (1 more water please, 1 more potty please), then perhaps this is due to separation anxiety.

This is normal! Your little one will want extra parental assurance. But that doesn't mean you need to sleep at the foot of their bed every night.

What they need is to learn to be comfortable in their own sleeping space, and that their parents will be close by. They now realise that by protesting, their parents will show up and stay with them. However, if you're reading this, I don't think you want to sleep on the floor of their room forever!



----



Should I re-train?

Personally, I don't think Ferber or Extinction is necessary for toddlers who already know how to sleep. It is definitely one way you can reinforce a boundary, but toddlers have the stamina to cry, A LOT. Not to mention they may try to escape their bedroom. 


----


Should I transition them into a toddler bed?

Not necessarily. This is a phase and will pass. But if your little one is climbing out then it's worth considering. You will need to hold the boundary that they need to sleep in their own beds.

---‐---

Explain the bedtime process

Your child is now older and capable of understanding how bedtime and sleep works. Even if they are not very verbal.

Show them where mum and dad sleeps, where the dog sleeps, etc. Everyone has a place where they sleep for the night. If they need something you will be able to help. It may sound obvious but sometimes kids don't realise where their loved ones go at night when they're alone in their room, and the prospect is scary.


---- --


Consider an okay to wake clock (changes colour at a set time)

This helps them understand that you will be back eventually. Until then, they need to stay in their bed. 

If they need to use the toilet, return them to bed once they're done.

Praise them for staying in until the clock ticks over to the wake time. We set the clock for a few minutes past our daughter's wake time to help her understand success. Eg. If she woke at 5:40am, we'd set it for 5:45, and celebrated her success. Then we slowly dialled it to the desired wake time. Eventually she stopped waiting for the clock to tick over and went back to sleep if it wasn't the right colour.

This could take a few days to start to take effect. Keep persisting as it helps illustrate when it's acceptable to leave bed (not 4am).


---- --


Fade out your presence 

If you're like me. You may have spent some uncomfortable nights sleeping with one hand on your kid's chest.

Shuffle your sad floor bed further away over successive nights. Explain you're right there. Once you're in the hallway, verbally assure your child from outside the door.

This may sound like torture so you can always try only going to the door to assure. Or only talking over the baby monitor.

How long this takes and its success will likely depend on your child's temperament. 


---- --


EDIT: another idea, a companion toy

Our daughter kept asking for the door to be kept wide open and lights on... until her Nana gave her one of those singing, star projecting toys. She doesn't even bother to say goodnight some days when she gets to have that toy in bed.

Be consistent, be patient, you will sleep again.

Good luck everyone!

Just 1 week shy of 8 months, healthy full term baby, sleep and nap trained since 4/5 months, napping and sleeping beautiful up until yesterday.

Wake up 6:30-7 (hard OOC time 7), bedtime 7:40 (asleep by 8 most days), wake windows 2:40-3 / 3 / 4-4:20.

Nap #1 is usually 45-90min (unbroken). Nap #2 is usually 45-90min (a little less consolidated, doesn't always link his cycles esp if morning sleep is long). Typically needs a micro-nap (5-10min) around 6PM to bridge to bedtime.

Usual night sleep 10.5-11.25 hours, daysleep 2.25-3 hours, total sleep \~13.5-14 hours.

We have settled into this stable rhythm for about a month, pushing on the wake windows slowly every week. He had been falling asleep <5 minutes at naps and <20 minutes at bedtime and having no night wakings.

**Starting about 2 days ago** I noticed more rocking and protestations at bedtime and nap #2, and nap #2 crapping out more. He's also figuring out crawling and babbling/talking a ton so I know that he's hitting some major developments.

**Today** he had a reasonable night sleep (10.75 hours) and woke up at 6:40 (usual window). Took a 1.5 hour nap in the morning. We went out on a nice field trip during which he practiced plenty of babbling, fed him 30min before his nap #2, and put him down for nap #2 at 3 hours. He rocked and shrieked for 30 minutes straight and had no inclination of going down. We got him up, played with him for another 30 minutes, put him down. He was rocking and shrieking again and eventually crying. At wake window 4:15 mark I gave up and rocked him, and he immediately conked out. I'm presuming he's gonna wake up in a cycle so will be foregoing nap #3 and putting to bed at maybe 7:20 (3:20 last wake window) so he can catch up on a bit of sleep at night.

And now I have read that active sleep also often seems as if the babies are awake.

Bedtime is 8 and he generally wakes up between 6:30-7. We can't seem to escape false starts and he always wakes up 30, 50, or 90 minutes later. Getting him to sleep the first time is either very easy or difficult, no in between. During the night, he's very occasionally capable of 3-4 hour stretches, but usually sleeps 1-2 hours at a time. Sometimes wakes up after 30 minutes. He is very opinionated and always wakes up in a very loud mood, so we've been leaning hard on the breast feed to sleep association because it's so effective and quick. Of course, that doesn't help if he's having one of those nights where he wakes up as soon as he is in the crib. 

Daytime is four naps. Averages 3-3.5 hours in total, sometimes as little as 2 and sometimes up to 4. Wake windows 1.5-2 hours. The first is often successful at putting him down while sleeping into the crib and is usually 30 minutes. Subsequent naps are in the carrier or boob/contact and are about 45-90 minutes. My mom watches him 3 times/week and he will crash nap for three hours there in her swing. Based off of what I've read these past few days, we might benefit from going to a three nap schedule and getting the daytime naps more reliable prior to sleep training. It seems like it's best to use any means necessary to increase daytime sleep lengths, whether contact or what.

703,sleeptrain,"Hi everyone,

First time parents to a lovely 2 month old. During the night, kiddo has a great first sleep of \~4-5 hours, however after that, wakes up every 50 minutes and major part of the time contact naps. The moment we put him in the crib, the alarm is sounding.

We are currently not trying any sleep training methods, only following a bedtime routine according to Precious Little Sleep, and trying to have a decent schedule during the day. We are using the Huckleberry app for tracking and their SweetSpot, so I also have some statistics which I hope might help. Usually we aim for a 4 or 5 nap day, depending on how the baby goes to sleep. 

We average 15hours of sleep per day. Out of which 9:30 during nights, and 5:30 naps during the day. We have a \~2 hour wake window before his night sleep. 

Morning: \~8:00  
Go to sleep: We aim for \~20:30, however he might only fall asleep \~21:50.

We don\`t know what we can do in order to make his 2\`nd night sleep last a bit longer.  
Sometimes he wakes up after his cycle of 50 minutes, and in order to go back to sleep needs to be rocked or fed. 

Did anyone face such a situation and how did you overcome it, should we only give it time, or is there anything we can do?

704,sleeptrain,"We started sleep training (modified ferber method) about a month ago. Our baby is 7 months old, 6 months adjusted. It took some figuring out, but she's finally able to put herself to sleep! For the last week, usually she slightly fusses or doesn't fuss at all when put down until she falls asleep, even if it takes her 30+ minutes to fall asleep.

 But now instead of waking up 4-6 times a night but only needing her pacifier to go back to sleep, shes waking 6+ times, often hourly or every few hours, and not going right back to sleep. Once to 3 times a night she wakes and will be up and crying on and off for 30 minutes to an hour. Sometimes she will get her pacifier back and act like she is asleep for 10 minutes and then she's up and again and that keeps repeating. Other times it's just constant. Usually it's about 3-4 hours after she first goes to bed, then around 1, and/or around 4/5. 

I understand right now because she is sick, but this started a few weeks ago before she was sick. I feel like instead of getting her to bed taking up to 3 hours, she's just spreading out awake time through the night.

I’m just curious what sort of schedules other 6.5 month olds are on (wake windows and nap lengths, wake/bed times). Also interested to hear opinions/experiences capping naps. 

Currently, we are doing 6:30-6:45 wake and 7:30/7:45 bed. Wake windows are pretty much 2.5/2.5/2.5/2.25-2.5 (depends how naps go cause we try not to shift bedtime). As of recently we can usually expect the first two naps to be 1.25-1.75 hrs and the last nap about .5 hrs - but I cap them all as needed so we can fit them all in. I’m wondering though if this will keep us stuck in a 3 nap sched.   I figure I’ll know we need to make a change when this stops working for us but want to know what we’re working towards.

My daughter is 15 weeks old. We’ve been cosleeping for the most part, i baby-wear a lot, recently bought a crib for her. We had a bassinet but she didn’t like sleeping in it. In the past month, she seems to be doing much better in the crib, taking 40 minute naps (regular for her) during the day. She still sleeps with us at night, we co-sleep safely and we’ve never had a real “wake up” she will fuss around a bit and take a dream feed and go back to sleep. She’s a pretty good sleeper at night so we thought maybe we should try her sleeping in the crib. I put the crib directly next to the bed so I can help calm her if needed. 

The first night went great. She struggled a little falling asleep but once she was asleep she slept as she would have with us. She did need my hand on her to calm her but she settled quickly. 
Last night though, she woke up at 4 am (fell asleep 8pm and had a 1/2 am dream feed) I don’t think she was fussing long because her eyes were beginning to open. She was still tired because when we tried to change her she started cranky-crying immediately. She fell back asleep from 5-7 am. 
She napped ok during the day, but after her second nap she was still tired and was extremely cranky. I bounced on the yoga hall til she fell asleep but when I put her in the crib she was upset again in minutes. I had to put her in a carrier and am just walking back and fourth in our apartment, hoping she wakes up happy this time. But now I feel so bad. I don’t want to mess up the good thing we have with her night sleeps. Part of me wants to give up and let her sleep in our bed tonight. 

Should I give up or keep trying? I thought from the first night it was going well but now I just feel awful. I know she is also teething and going through the “sleep-regression” phase. I just want to help her sleep well though the night. 

Also I know there is a thing about waiting til six months to stop co-sleeping as that is when babies begin to efficiently self-soothe. I tried putting her in the crib because it seemed like she might be ready, she doesn’t like to cuddle with me before bed anymore and just wants her own space and only wakes up about 1-3 time, nothing I can’t handle from a bedside crib. She’s also getting big and trying to roll; I worry about safe sleeping.

712,sleeptrain,"Hi- we’re in the middle of the third/fourth day of CIO, naps and bedtime, for our 10 MO boy. More details on the plan here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/zqyka1/feedback\_on\_cio\_plan\_for\_10mo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/zqyka1/feedback_on_cio_plan_for_10mo/)), but the plan was extinction because check ins just rile him up even more and a gentler method of shh/pat did not yield any real results other than cries at 4.5 months. Our main goal is for him to fall asleep independently and reliably instead of doing an unpredictable 30-60 mins of carrying/bouncing/etc for nearly every put down. He usually has 0 or 1 night wakeup, and while I’d love that to go away what I’m really trying to get back is the hours of carrying and bouncing for put down. On a roughly 3/3.25/4.25 schedule.

Day 1: Bedtime 20 mins moderate crying. Unexpected. He’s generally pretty fussy and crazy high energy so we were expecting much longer. 

Day 2: first nap 4 mins crying, second nap 27 mins crying, bedtime 14 minutes. He woke up overnight at about 2a. I gave him 10 mins, checked on him and when I set him back down after checking to leave he escalated so severely. After 45 mins there was no sign of sleep and I couldn’t handle how upset he was so I went and got him and took 60 more mins to calm and get him to sleep using every bad sleep habit there is. Before starting this plan for night wakes I’d been giving him \~5 mins, he’d sometimes settle, or then I’d go rock to sleep usually in about 10-15 mins, so this was really bad compared to normal. He never needs anything at these wakeups - diaper, food, etc all fine - just the help to fall back asleep. 

Day 3: Overtired today based on last night -- first nap 14 mins of crying. Second nap 14 mins. Bedtime 10 mins, no night wakeup and slept longer which was nice. All three times he was fine during the routine and started screaming as soon as I leaned down to set him in the crib, before I left the room - it was getting slightly earlier each time. The crying today was way more definitely intense/upset/angry. 

Day 4 (today): first nap - going on 45 minutes of crying now and no sign of sleep. Expecting we will need to take him out and reset. This time he started crying even before I finished the bedtime routine or approached the crib. He seems to be recognizing what’s happening earlier and earlier each put down and starting to cry sooner. 

A few questions:

* Is this  on track? My biggest worry is that we put him through this for several days and he doesn’t really make progress (that’s what happened with the prior gentle method attempt - first couple days seemed like we were on track to progress then there was just no progress!) 15-30 mins of aggressive yelling every put down is shorter than our old methods but if it doesn't get much better I’d probably prefer the old methods since I struggle so much with the screaming. Today's nap was really rough.
* He's crying/yelling sooner and sooner in the routine, each time. He doesn’t even have a chance to fall asleep calmly. Is this normal for day 4? Is there anything we could do? When he starts to realize it he just goes bonkers.
* If we treat night wakeups differently than nap/bedtime put downs, will that undermined him learning to fall sleep independently? Our primary goal is to get those put downs under control - can I handle a night wakeup with some rocking or will that really undermine the primary goal?",Questions - day 4 of CIO (10 mo),1671907169.0

She mostly STTN and has for over a month. But, she has taken to VERY active sleep from about 4-6 AM. Grunting, rolling around, yelling, etc. but usually settled immediately with a pacifier and hand on the chest. Sometimes we have to settle several times but it’s clear that she is still asleep.

Then as she gets closer to her actual wake up time she gets more active/difficult to settle, but still seems to be asleep? For example, at 6:30 this morning (perfectly reasonable wake up time) she started crying and thrashing about. I hadn’t checked the clock yet so I rolled over, leaned into her bassinet and she settled briefly. Cue crying 2 min later; I notice the hour and turn on the lamp and get ready to pull her out of her bassinet to nurse her, but I see her eyes are completely closed and she still seems asleep! 

I ended up picking her up (need a 6:30/9:30/12:30/3:30 schedule today), and it turns out she WAS asleep because her eyes flitted open and she was clearly startled when I undid her sleep sack. 

What I should be doing in these circumstances? Go ahead and wake her? What if this is at 5/5:30 AM? Do you wake and feed or just try to sleep through the thrashing?

It just seems weird to me that she won’t settle but is also clearly not awake…

One additional factor: we transitioned out of the Ollie swaddle over the past 10 days and she is now in a zipadee zip sleep sack.

She has never taken to drowsy but awake. This is the advice I ALWAYS get while simultaneously being told that a baby under 4 months can’t go down drowsy but awake so it’s always been super confusing and I just gave into rocking to sleep. I got used to the rocking and her night wakes were less and less so I was coping fine with it. I still try drowsy but awake once in a while and it never ever works. 

But now she refuses her naps even with rocking and I’m just at a loss. I’ve tried shortening wake windows, lengthening them, even tried feeding to sleep which worked for maybe a week and no longer works. 

I have gone back and forth with the idea of sleep training but I’m at the point where I’d rather just get it over with so that I can get some sleep. I don’t have help from my partner who works late hours so I have to sleep train alone.

3:30 nap 4 (45 minutes)

6:30pm bedtime 

I adjust the naps and bedtime by 15 mins or so depending on when she wakes up for the day. 

She sleeps in the Snoo, swaddled, dark room, white noise, rocked and bottle fed to sleep. Takes me 5-10 mins to rock her to sleep, then I transfer her after 10-15 mins. 

This is all on a good day / how it used to be. For the past 3 days she has had contact naps or no naps at all, and timing has been all over the place. We’ve even had some 5:30pm bedtimes because of the lack of daytime sleep. 

We will be staying with family for the entire month of January and they have rented us a Snoo while we are there, so we can’t transition to the crib just yet. We also have some family visiting this week for the holidays.

She nurses every 2-2.5 hours during day and has also been on solids now for 3 months which she enjoys).  

LO is not awesome at all with the bottle, so a lot of this falls on me and this does not feel sustainable for when I return to work in a few weeks. When this girl cries she can be intense about it.

Some nights he cries 45 minutes, and sometimes he’ll be fine and goes down perfectly. I’d say we were getting better but now all the sudden he’s just terrible! I have no idea if it’s 8-month regression or if he’s just unhappy with our routine. Any advice?

- feed him in the kitchen
- read to him for ~20-30 mins
- in crib drowsy but awake

7am wake  
9am nap 1  
1pm nap 2  
4pm nap 3  
6:15pm start bedtime routine  
7pm bed

She sleeps in a crib in a dark room with white noise. Her bedtime routine is diaper change, pajamas, sleep sack, brush teeth, book, nurse. 

Currently my baby’s naps are variable in length with the vast majority being 30 minutes, and strongly prefers a late bedtime and late wake up. She would love it if she could sleep 11pm to 10am and has the fewest night wakings when she sleeps in that timeframe. Her wake windows are 2-2.5 hours long. 

I’m having troubles implementing this schedule. On days when she has short naps, she is extremely overtired and is desperate for a fourth nap. The fourth nap pushes bedtime back to 9pm or later. When she randomly gives us a longer nap, she does better on 3 naps but the long naps are completely unpredictable. 

Trying to push her bedtime earlier has resulted in multiple false starts. The earlier the bedtime, the more false starts. She wakes every 30 minutes and I nurse or bounce her to sleep each time. This continues until 11pm-ish when she finally sleeps for the night…sort of. She continues to wake every 2-3 hours until morning.

I was wondering if I could get some tips for my just shy of 6m old. Originally I was dealing with some EMWs which have mostly resolved thanks to the tips I got here, but now the start of her night has been a little wonky and I'd like to think it's because she is going to need to stretch her WWs soon! The past few nights she has been waking about 1.5 hours after we put her to sleep. Is that what you call a false start? Last night it was worse with taking an hour to fall asleep and fussing on and off. She seemed pretty tired but she just couldn't settle. I did not have to go in and comfort her though. We are in leap 5 with about 2 weeks left so I don't know if that could contribute to things. It doesn't appear that her teeth are popping through but I do think her gums bother her sometimes.

Currently the schedule is something like 2.25-2.5/2.5/2.25/2.5. Her wake up time is 6:30, which is completely fine with us because we are awake to WFH and take care of the pets too. I keep a consistent bedtime of 7:30pm. Her last feed ends 30 mins before she's put down also. She naps very well, independently. Usually 1.5 hours for nap one, then nap 2 is like 1.15-1.20 then a short nap around 4:30-5. A lot of times though she doesn't really want to take the last nap and I don't want to push it later because I'm afraid it will screw with her bedtime! Should I just push bedtime later or should we try a ladder schedule of 2/3/4? I know she can handle 3 hours but we haven't tried to push her past that.

My 3mo sleeps pretty much through the night. He will still wiggle himself awake but can always resettle and I usually feed him once around 4am. He takes a bottle to sleep (which I also have concerns about if I should not be associating feed to sleep? But if it works and I’m not having issues, is it that bad?)

Anyways his wake windows are usually 1.5-2hours. I watch for sleep cues rather than strict window times. I usually nurse him for a few minutes until he falls asleep and then either move him t the crib or contact nap. 

For his first nap of the day I try to do the crib but he usually only sleeps about 30min. How can I get this to an hour? 

For his second nap I generally contact nap and that can be about 2-2.5 hours but obvi this is not sustainable as I can’t get anything done and will be returning to work soon. 

Third nap it depends on what time it is- I try to keep at least a two hour wake window before bedtime so if I need him to catnap I will contact nap but if I have time to try for the crib I’ll do that.

For the past few days he has seriously been fighting sleep. As soon as he’s put down for naps and at bedtime he will stand in his crib and cry. Sometimes he’ll quiet down and cruise in circles in his crib for a bit before sitting down and falling asleep. If we go in to lay him down, he wakes up and screams again. We’ve left him for two hours last night and he just sat there sleeping on and off and startling himself awake. If he manages to fall asleep laying down, he will wake up between sleep cycles and stand as soon as his eyes pop open instead of trying put himself back to sleep like he usually does. 

He’s been pulling to stand and cruising for a couple months now so these aren’t new skills. He is, however, starting to take 4-5 steps independently so he’s getting closer to being able to walk.

At about the 2.5 month mark, I started paying really close attention to her wake windows. After that, I was able to get her down for one sleep cycle at every nap & night time. That was a huge win at the time. But since then, it’s plateaued. It’s still the same. We can only get her to go down for her one sleep cycle, and like clockwork, she’s up between 30-45 minutes & will not go down if we try. However, we can rescue her naps/sleep if we transfer her to contact nap/sleep quickly. She has been sleeping through the entire night (about 10-11 hours) since the 1.5 month mark. She also dropped her night feed on her own at the same time.

Contact sleeping has become an issue for us. She doesn’t do well on me (I think she can smell my milk), it’s uncomfortable with my breasts in the early morning & she just doesn’t fit my chest anymore. She’s a big girl & I’m quite petite. My husband (bless his heart) has been taking her for nights, he has a larger surface area on his chest. But the poor guy hasn’t slept in our bed for a long time & says she’s getting more fidgety at night so he isn’t sleeping well at all. I get barely any time to myself during the day because I have to stay with her for her naps. For the first half of her nap, she tends to move around a lot & is at risk for waking herself up. So I have to stay to make sure she stays down. Once she enters the deep sleep stage, I have about 20 minutes for myself, which isn’t enough time do to much.

We have tried everything for her to be more comfortable in her crib. Swaddles, sleep sacks, pacifier, warming her bed, shushing, patting, have our scent on her sheets, I could go on. Nothing works. Although she does use a pacifier to put herself to sleep. But it sucks because it often falls out & she wakes up (hence why I have to stay with her at the beginning of her nap). We use white noise, dark room, we have our same bedtime & nap time routine everyday. I don’t know what else to do.

Since we are fast approaching 4 months, we have been talking a lot about sleep training, because this can’t continue. She’s also showing signs of rolling. So it would be safest if she could be in her crib. We know she can connect her sleep cycles, but it’s only when she’s on top of us. I understand that we are the assistance that is helping her do that.

Since he has been sitting, crawling, babbling, learning so much in the past few months his overnight sleep involves waking every 1hr to 3 hrs at the most and requiring nursing back to sleep every time. His dad is terrible at crib transfers for some reason (not I problem I have) and ends up rocking baby for a long while only to have him wake and scream requiring nursing to calm down after being startled to wake. 

I also CAN rock him to sleep but frankly I’m so physically exhausted that plopping in the nursing chair for 15 minutes is easier. But it’s getting to the point where he’s transferring too many calories at night and it’s becoming routine. Any advice or experience with this?

At 3.5mo we believe we had the 4 month sleep regression after night wakings every 1-2 hours and naps that lasted only 20 minutes. Since that ended he started sleeping 7pm-5am, would wake for a bottle, and sometimes would be up for the morning and other times would go back down for maybe another 40 minutes or so. However, this week his false starts at night, which used to be manageable at only once or twice, has turned into multiple wakings between 7-10pm, but once we get him down he'll at least stay asleep for 30-60 minutes. Starting around 11 he's up constantly - every 5-10 minutes. We've started giving him a small feed of 100ml around midnight and that helped in the first few days in getting him to sleep a longer stretch, but not lately.

Our daytime schedule is wake up around 5am, diaper, feed, sometimes a nap or sometimes he's up, but this tends to be a short wake window of 1 hour before he goes back down.

752,sleeptrain,"We have been doing FIO for our 5 month old the last 6 days with what I would say moderate success. 

Without going into too much detail, she has been crying / fussing herself to sleep within 20 minutes or so, BUT has woken up within 1 hour from falling asleep, on nights 3,5 & 6 of the 6 days. Each time we gave her 10 minutes to self soothe (with no success) before feeding her back to sleep as previously done.

Q1. Any suggestions on how to prevent/ avoid this the wake ups?
We make sure her last wake window is around 3 hours before bed time.

Our bedtime routine is breastfeed, read book, sing & rock until sleepy in darkened room and put down.
As soon as we put her down in her crib she starts fussing & is crying as soon as we close the door. Sometimes during the singing & rocking stage she'll start becoming agitated.

Q2. Should we be only putting her in bed & leaving when she's calm? Is this a sign of a sleep aversion, meaning we should adjust our sleep routine? 
(She hates baths so we don't do that for bedtime)

Currently her bedtime is around 9.30pm which is later than what most schedules advise.
Our general schedule is:
Wake: 7.30am
Nap 1: 9am - 9.30am
Nap 2: 11.30am - 12pm 
Nap 3: 2.15pm - 3.15pm (extend to 1 hour via contact nap)
Nap 4: 6pm - 6.30pm

We did dream feed before we went to bed, then he usually slept for a solid 6 hours before waking up hungry.

No more.

Suddenly, naps are much easier, but bedtime is rough. Lots of tears and rocking, but he's still managing to eventually go to sleep on his own. He has always been such a light sleeper that transferring him asleep is impossible anyway. His sleep is also quite fitful with some false start bed times mixed in. It's frustrating, but manageable. What is really killing me is he is suddenly waking up every 3 hours again at night. He's sooooo close to crawling, and I see him on the monitor up in bear crawl position, crying into the mattress. He moces into all fours in his sleep. He then won't settle unless I nurse him, which I know is a terrible habit, but at times he seems genuinely hungry. He's small and not a great eater during the day, and with all the moving and shaking he's doing now, it's hard to know.

After about 1 week I started to see improvement. I then pushed this to 75 minutes. He will still wake up and cry sometimes but for the most he is doing great on connecting cycles and going back to sleep when he does wake up! He will take 2+ hour naps on the regular!

We try to get him back down without feeding, but if he’s still crying for 15+ minutes, we often resort to a bottle. We don’t nurse for wakings from bedtime-midnight, but we do bf for wakings from midnight-7am (he usually wakes twice during this time).

2. She has been a contact napper since like day one. Any time we lay her down in her crib or Bassinet drowsy but awake, she instantly is wide awake and it can take up to an hour to get her asleep. It's there a point where you give up and try again later?

785,sleeptrain,"We have two children, the older one is 3.5 years and the younger one is 1.75 years old. We Ferberized the older one, there were multiple attempts but it ""stuck"" when he was about 1.25 years old. Now, we bring him to bed, read a story, and stay in the room until he sleeps. Sometimes there's a tantrum but normally it works well and then it's a couple of hours until he wakes up and wants to come to our bed. We don't mind that as it's in the middle of the night. At least he lets us have a relaxed evening from, say, 7 to 11 pm.

Now, the younger one is more difficult. He's at a stage where he can't really go through the day without a nap but when he has one he can't fall asleep until very late (say 9-10 pm). We try to offer an early (11 am) nap but he refuses normally and then falls asleep in the buggy or on the floor around 2 pm - we do wake him up after half an hour or so but the damage is already done. So it's quite hard to get him to bed at night and often times we let him stay up and go to bed with him around 9 pm (doesn't mean we have to sleep, we can be on our phones, but stuff like watching a horror movie or being intimate isn't possible then). He knows that and says he wants to go to the big bed when we try to put him into his bed. Even if we get him to sleep early (because he didn't have a nap maybe) he wakes up multiple times, in the early evening. Sometimes we can give him a drink and put him back in, sometimes he refuses to go back to sleep unless it's in the big bed. I don't mind taking him after say 10 pm or so when I need to go to sleep myself.

We dabbled a bit with sleep training when he was younger but he seemed to be even more stubborn than his big brother and also we don't want his endless screaming to disturb our oldest. **I wonder if it's worth attempting sleep training again at his age or whether he'll grow out of it soon and become like his brother.** I can't remember at what age he became predictable.

My baby has always had a weird sleep schedule, and I am wondering if it is normal or not..

Normal day
Wake up is between 9:30 or 10:30 am
Nap starts at 1 or 2 pm and lasts 2 hours 
Bedtime is between 9 pm and 10 pm 

There is some variance on nights she is teething, mostly that she wakes up more at night and wants to be held. 

She wakes up once (sometimes twice during a growth spurt) over night for a quick bottle. Goes back to sleep immediately. My pediatrician says that she should not be waking up for a bottle but that it is ok because she is trying to catch up on her weight. 

She is 9.5 months old.
I have always just followed my babies lead for sleeping. If I try to put her down other times when she is not tired or earlier, she just cries in my arms and tries to play with my hair/shirt/necklace. She is immediately better and smiling when I put her back on the floor to play. 

I’ve tried waking her up earlier to start the day earlier, and what happens is that she ends up taking 2 naps. The first is about 4 hours after she wakes up and the second ends up being 4-5 pm. She then won’t sleep for the night until very late because she has no interest in sleeping and wants to play. The next morning, I feel way too bad waking her up early again because she didn’t get enough sleep overnight and is sooo tired.

These past 6 weeks have involved multiple wakeups a night (last night being up for about ~2 hours).

I am getting to my wits end and want to start at least implementing some of the fever method themes, but my wife has always been against having the LO cry for more than ~30 sec.

Szenario 1: One of the babies wakes up after 20 minutes after going down. This continues the entire night in space of 20 minutes up to two hours of sleeping.

Do we just let them cry again the entire night?


Szenario 2: Babies sleep well for the first 4 hours. They usually get fed at 2am and around 5am. They wake up crying before 2am. 

Do we feed immediately or at the designated feeding time? What if they've been crying for 20 minutes before, doesnt that just reinforce bad habits since youre not supposed to go in till baby falls asleep on their own again?


Szenario 3: Babies Wake Up Time for the day is 8:10am, pretty much on the dot if theres nothing weird going on. Baby A wakes up at 6 am after being fed at 5. 

Do i let him cry till he falls asleep again? Isnt sleep pressure too low at this point? What time would I ""give in"" and start the day, if he doesnt fall asleep again?


Szenario 4: Babies get fed at 2 and at 5 am. They dont falls asleep after and start crying in bed again. 

Do i calm them down while laying them in their bed or do i just like drop them and leave the room, while they continue to cry? 


Id be really thankful for anyone who can help with any of the questions. Im feeling really unsure how much my babies can tolerate at this point and also how to not enforce any bad habits so theyre crying even more, instead if less.

794,sleeptrain,"**First some background:**

Our son is almost 19 weeks old, so about 4.5 months. Born 2 weeks early.

Since about two weeks (10th of December afternoon to be precise) we seem to have enabled him falling to sleep for naps independently. It's currently just the routine, put him in his swaddle sleepsack and leave the room. He moans/whines for 5-10 minutes and sleeps, never any real crying. Before that we had about 1.5 months of only naps in the carrier while walking around in the dark in the hallway, so this has really been a big step forward. 

Those naps were also often short. Current morning and noon naps can be anything between 1.5 to 2.5 hours, but closer to 2 hours is typical I would say. We're honestly not sure if we should wake him up after 2 hours as that's something we picked up from the endless Googling and reading. The final afternoon nap has been between 10 and 40 minutes, we're not sure if we should extend this with some help like rocking to sleep as we did before.

Nights started of really really well, typically only 1x awake for a feed and that was it. Until beginning of November where it started to be 2-3 times. Together with the carrier naps this really drained my partner (I had to start working again already some time ago + for some time he didn't want to nap on me in the carrier......)

**And now for the help request:**

Now with the day naps in check (we think?) we do still have some trouble with the nights. The first stretch is pretty great we would say. At minimum it's 4 hours or a bit longer, reaching 5 hours last night and even 6h15min the night before. Awesome!

After this first wake he gets a bottle which should then cover him until the morning. After getting it he normally falls asleep again quite quickly (in arms and then carried over in bed). All good here.

The second stretch is where we need help. This is between 2.5 and at the very max 4 hours. On average let's say 3h45min give or take. He wakes up pretty happy from it. Blowing bubbles, perhaps moaning a little bit but definitely no crying. He seems much more awake compared to waking from the 1st stretch. And then we don't know what to do… We've waited once for 40 minutes with no changes, he looks and sounds happy. Last night we waited 10 min, took him out, diaper, put back, but then he was mainly whining and moaning so we got him out of his crib and got him to sleep whilst rocking on my partners legs (this method works really well for us, but it's exhausting). Eventually transferred back to bed, but he only slept for 40 min and as it was 5:45 we decided to start the day. Other days we've taken him out and rockes to sleep after which he slept a bit longer, sometimes in two parts.

We're just not sure what to do at night when this happens. Should we take him out, rock to sleep so at least he gets some more sleep (and us as well), or should we wait for an hour? 1.5 hours? Is there something ""wrong"" with his naps still…?

I've made some screenshots of his sleep and feeding. Light blue is naps, dark blue night sleep. Orange breast feeding, pink bottle.

809,sleeptrain,"Honest question. Is this because it likely won’t be effective because they’re too young, or because people feel it’s cruel to let a baby that young cry? Or is it simply because it hasn’t been studied in babies that young? 

Reason I ask - my first was the worlds worst sleeper, and out of desperation we successfully sleep trained her (with a sleep consultant) starting at 12 weeks. We did this at the advice of our friends who worked with the same person at 9(!!!) weeks. 

It was a gradual 10-day effort, and she was allowed to eat at night if she woke due to hunger (but we had to “hold to her best”). She was a fantastic sleeper afterwards, by 4 months when I went back to work she slept from 8-7 without wake-up’s. She is now 2 and a great sleeper. She didn’t go through a single sleep regression since she already knew how to put herself to sleep independently by the time those are supposed to hit. 

It wasn’t until later that I heard you shouldn’t sleep train until 4-6 months, oops! My sleep consultant said any time after 8 weeks is okay, so I went with that. 

I’ve heard that babies can’t self-soothe until 4 months, but my LO was chewing her hands and playing with her hands when trying to sleep, which I think is a form of self-soothing. My second baby does the same.

815,sleeptrain,"Hello everyone, first time dad here trying to navigate the quirks of a new baby.

For the past ten days our 14 week old has been waking up at 1:30AM and we aren't able to get him back to sleep until 6 or 7.  He used to only wake for feedings, where my wife would breastfeed him 2 or 3 times through the night, but he would go right back to bed afterwards.  The night will go likes this now:

* Nighttime routine starts at 8:45PM and includes a final feeding (7 oz bottle with mix of breast milk and formula), diaper change, reading books, then 5 minutes of holding upright quietly. 
* LO is put down in their crib completely awake around 9:30 and falls asleep on his own around 9:40.
* He will then wake up in 35 to 40 minutes, move around for about 10 minutes until he seems comfortable and seems to sleep, only to wake up 2 minutes later.  He will normally cry for 3-4 minutes here then fall back to sleep until 1 or 1:30AM.
* When he wakes up, my wife breastfeeds him in bed until he is asleep, then puts him back in the crib.  He will open his eyes immediately upon hitting the mattress then kick his arms and legs for about 20 minutes before crying.
* We try picking him up and rocking him which calms him down, but if you put him down still awake he starts crying immediately.  If you put him down asleep, he'll wake up after 10 minutes and start fussing until he full blown cries.  We have also tried letting him cry for 5 minutes but it just escalates into screaming until we comfort him again.  Using a pacifier seems to comfort him for a little, but he will eventually start crying with it still in.
* This process continues through a second feeding at 4:30AM and it isn't until around 6 that he finally will go to sleep and remain asleep until 10 AM.  We check and change his diaper, make sure he isn't too hot or cold, and rule out anything that we can fix that may be causing it.

He has gone through a number of recent changes over the past month that I feel worth mentioning:

* He used to be terrible at napping, getting only 30 minute to 1 hour naps and normally not sleeping at all for 6 hours before bedtime.  We started following the Sweet Spots on Huckleberry which really helped him sleep for naps more consistently.
* He will wake up after 30 to 40 minutes of sleep at night and was super hard to get back to sleep.  It seemed like he never wanted to sleep until 12:30AM at that point so we switched his bedtime to 12AM which seemed to work temporarily.  We then tried to roll his bedtime back by 15 minutes each day, while also moving is wake time back 15 minutes as well, until his bedtime is 10PM and wake time is 10AM.  Throughout this whole time, he would still wake after 30-40 minutes though and takes hours to get back down.
* He learned to fall asleep independently for naps about two weeks ago.  We can now put him down 10 minutes before his Sweet Spot and he will fall asleep in 5-10 minutes without any crying or fussing.  When he started falling asleep on his own, his naps got so much better to where we have to wake him after 2 hours for his first two naps of the day.  Last week, he learned to do this for his bedtime as well, which I was really hoping was going to solve this problem.
* We've changed him from 4 naps to 3 naps this past weekend.  He was doing two 1.5 hours naps in the morning, then an hour nap in the afternoon, with a final 30 minute nap ending 2 hours before bedtime.  Now he wakes up at 10, naps from 11:30 to 1:30, 3:10 to 5:10, then a final 30 minutes nap from 7:10 to 7:40.  He gets a 6 oz bottle after each wake up (3oz breast milk/3oz gentle formula) with his final bottle being at 8:40 with 7oz total.

My wife and I are both really struggling since he won't sleep overnight which means we cannot either.  I know that there are sleep regressions that happen around this time, so I don't know if this is a temporary thing or if there is something we can do to help in sleep at night.  I appreciate any suggestions you all have and am happy to answer any questions to help.

I’ve tried leaving him in his crib in the morning longer and 9 times out of 10 he won’t fall back to sleep. He’s also a serial night pooper so there’s usually a poop when he wakes up in the morning. No idea when it happens or else I’d go in and change it. If go in and change his diaper when he wakes up in the morning and put him back in the crib, there’s no way he’d go back to sleep.

820,sleeptrain,"Hi everyone! 

I've got a 10 week old. I'm looking for feedback on how to improve my own baby's sleep and move back bedtime.

At the beginning of bedtime, he sleeps 3-4 stretches which I think is great (my first only slept 1-3 hours at a time).

Here's baby’s situation right now:

•	Bedtime is around 11pm. A few weeks ago it was at 9:30/10 then somehow jumped to 11 after a day of bad naps.

•	for the last two nights, I’ve been trying to do a 2h wake windows before bed and maneuver his nap schedule so that the bedtime is 15m earlier than the night before . First night 2h worked great with baby sleeping right away at 10:30pm for a 3h stretch. However, last night it was a struggle to keep him awake so he slept 1.75h after the last nap at 10:10 and woke up 20min later. I fed him to sleep and he slept at 11pm. 

- wake windows are 1.25-5 then trying for 1.5 during day (but he’s too cranky/tired) and in evening 1.75-2. 

•	Bedtime routine for baby is white noise, dim light, feed, change diaper, wipe face, change into PJs/swaddle sack.

•	I think he's still sorting out his day/nights because he’s extremely tired and often cranky during the afternoon in the last week. He has about 6 naps a day ranging from 30m (if put in bassinet) to 2h. Wake window in the morning is 1.25-1.5 but then he gets super tired in the afternoon. In the afternoon, he might sleep for an hour with a contact nap with transfer to bassinet then I wake to feed and he falls asleep for another hour and if we put him down and he wakes up he’s extremely grumpy until we put him back down with a contact nap. 

I’ve been trying to wake him up at 7:30am no matter how late he sleeps but sometimes he’s fallen back asleep while he’s hanging out with family in the kitchen. I’m wondering if i should let him sleep in since he sleeps so late? Should I try to find out his natural wake up time and then slowly wake him up a bit earlier each day?

•	I've been trying to put baby into bed drowsy but awake at bedtime and at nap #1, which has been somewhat successful. His other naps have been rock/feed/wear to sleep and then sometimes transfer to another surface. For his last nap, I wear him so I can spend more time with the toddler and take part in toddler's bedtime routine before he goes to sleep.

- Nap 2: 3:15-4 (capped - though he often wakes around 4)
- Bedtime: 8:15

Last week LO started fighting Nap 2 and then he flat out refused it Thursday and Friday. He took it on Saturday, but then fought bedtime for 30 minutes (he’s normally down in about 10). We cut Nap 1 to 10-11:20 on Sunday and kept all other times as is. It worked great, then Monday morning he took a 30ish minute Nap 1 and woke up happy/ready to go. We put him down early for Nap 2 and woke him at 4, and he got about an hour of sleep then. He fought bedtime Monday night (probably because he got 1 hr 30 min of daytime sleep rather than 1 hr 50 min/2 hours). I noticed LO recently had been waking up at 6:40ish and laying in his crib (happily) until I got him at 7, but Monday I woke him at 7. I thought he might need a slightly longer first WW, so we did Nap 1 from 10:10 - 11:30 yesterday. Last night we had a false start and LO was up for about two hours from 9-11 (I went in to “help” which is retrospect probably made things worse).  LO also fell asleep during his walk before dinner, was showing major sleeping cues during bath - things that never happen. Once LO was down at 11 he slept until a little before 7 AM when he woke up on his own. He’s his normal happy self this morning. 

Hypothesis: I’m pretty sure the initial wobbles (skipping Nap 2, fighting bedtime, short Nap 1) were because LO was slightly undertired. However, I think at this point LO is overtired from all of these wobbles, only made worse by last night’s false starts.  

Questions: 

1. Does this hypothesis make sense to you? I know so much of baby sleep is knowing your kid and trying different things out, but I’m so close to this I would love some extra eyes (and while I could talk baby sleep for forever, I’m pretty sure my very sweet and patient husband has hit his max haha). 

2. If you agree with my hypothesis - how would you handle? I’m thinking today we do Nap 1 at 10 and let him sleep as long as he wants, and Nap 2 at 3:15 and let him sleep as long as he wants. But then what? We still have the initial wobbles to deal with. Maybe we try the 10:10-11:30 Nap 1 in a day or two (once it seems like LO has caught up on sleep and we’re no longer seeing overtired signs)?

ETA: For anyone who comes across this post in the future - as commenters suggested, I think WW 2 and Nap 2 were our issue. LO started extending Nap 2, and by waking him at 4 we weren’t letting him get a full sleep cycle, which was making him cranky and sort of a mess by bedtime. I also think our WW 2 was too long - we shortened Nap 1 instead to help Nap 2. We’re doing 3/3.5/4.25, with wake at 7, Nap 1 from 10-11:15 (capped), Nap 2 from 2:45-3:45 (capped), and bed at 8.

Her naps can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, usually around 45 mins. Even with contact naps she won’t sleep more than an hour. Wake around 6:30, nap 8:45-9, wake 9:30-10, next nap 12-12:30, wake 1-1:30, nap 3:30-4, up by 4:30 and bedtime 6:45-7. She gets overstimulated with baths so we do those in the morning. Bedtime routine is pajamas, eat, books, bed. She seems to know to eat a good meal if we put her in her pajamas. I tried waiting to do this after eating but she would just snack. Have also tried different outfits incase she’s hot or cold but that doesn’t seem to make a difference. She has been waking every two hours but I don’t feed her every time, only if she gets loud and won’t self soothe. Any advice?",6 month schedule check-increased night wakings!,1671629298.0

I have started implementing a slow weaning method I found on Reddit where this week I start at 4 hours after his night feed where I will not feed him. Then starting next week we’ll move up to 4.5 hours of no feed after his night feed and continue extending from there. He’s 99th percentile for weight and height so the only reason I still feed him at night is because I don’t know if he is genuinely hungry or not. But I would like to gradually wean him. He is exclusively breast-fed, and I plan to completely stop breast-feeding at a year old I am fine with two or three night feeds for now but I don’t know how to stop the constant waking every 2 hours.

840,sleeptrain,"So my partner and I have been co-sleeping with our baby when he turned 6 1/2 months(now 7 months). For context we room share the room with our baby since my parents live with us in our 2 bedroom home. We didn't want to co-sleep but we realized he kept waking up at night because he felt cold(he's always slept in a footed onesie, covered hands, and a blanket tucked into the sides of the crib) but now that it's winter where we live he had a hard time staying in his crib throughout the night without waking up. He'd lay down fine for the night, but would wake up in the middle of the night and refused to sleep in his crib, but quickly fell sleep with us in bed. 

So we opted to have him sleep between us and he stays asleep until the next morning with no issues. However, he gets extremely warm, and uncomfortable when too warm so we want to transition him to his crib before summer comes (he turns 1 year old in May).

He's also a BIG MOVER in the crib while he sleeps, but he doesn't do that while he sleeps with us, I don't know what it is. Maybe because he's in a ""mini crib"" that's 40.35"" L x 25.28"" W x 40.9"" H, and he hits the side rails with his hands when he moves. He recently started sleeping in a sleep sack and it's helped, when he had just the blanket he'd kick it off, waking himself up. Another thing that caused issue with laying for the night in his crib is he recently learned to somewhat stand so we lowered the crib a level and laying him down is even harder because as we lay him down, he wakes up. 

I had started sleep training him when he was 6 months old and it was going ok, but then winter hit and all went down hill from there.

843,sleeptrain,"My baby is turning 6 months next week, and ever since he was 3 weeks old he would only sleep via contact on my chest or cradled after falling asleep feeding. We sleep in a recliner chair for the entirety of the 6 months. At week 3 he was sleeping in a pack and play during a nap, woke up screaming bloody murder, and ever since has not wanted to be put down for naps or night sleep. It was convenient to have him on me for feeding purposes at night when I was recovering from my c-section, but I'd really love to sleep in a bed. He will not bedshare and sleep beside me.

Rocking in a chair doesn't cut it for him, and he needs to be waltzed around the room upright on my shoulder. He doesn't like being cradled to rock like a baby. This makes the transition into a crib hard because it's moving him upright to flat on his back, and it's a lot of movement.

I've been trying to transition him to his crib, and I've tried everything and nothing works. If I put him down awake or drowsy, he cries and  screams until I pick him up and soothe him by waltzing him around the room for as long as it takes.

If I put him down asleep 99.9% of the time he will wake up. I've tried feet first, bum first, whole body, dangle over as much as possible, wait 5 minutes, wait 10 minutes, wait 20 minutes, put on his belly, etc. He will not stay asleep and will wake up. I've tried this beside me on a bed too, and he will wake up.  In the .1% he has stayed asleep on the transfer he wakes up in less than 10 minutes crying, and then screaming if not attended to. I will usually try 3 times, and then succumb to the contact sleep in the recliner, unless he is particularly upset and it takes a long time to soothe him I will go to the recliner in the interest of him getting sleep.

I've tried heating the crib to make it warm. I have him in a 2.5 TOG sleepsack to keep him warm since he's used to being on me. I can shush him, stroke his head, give him a pacifier, apply weight with my hands, pat him bum, etc. Nothing soothes him until he's picked up. 

Some nights he wakes up a lot looking to feed, some nights only 2-3 times. I don't care about night feedings, I will get up to do those if I need to, but I just need him in the crib.

861,sleeptrain,"10mo has seemed to be low sleep needs. Currently only doing  11-12 hours total per day, although... we are having to help him to sleep for all naps and bedtime... so maybe if he could fall asleep on his own he'd do a little more? We think he might be ready for sleep training -- can we get feedback on plan?

Current schedule: Wake up anywhere from 5:30-6:30; 9:45 nap 1 (anywhere from :45-1:45); 3:00 nap 2 (usually :30-:45). We've worked hard to stabilize bedtime and he's now consistently falling asleep 8:10-8:20. He'll usually wake up 1 or 0 times overnight and need a quick rock to sleep, and his night sleep is only between 9-10 total hours. So it's roughly a 3:15-4:15/3:15-4:15/4:30-5:00 schedule?? 😵‍💫 It's a small miracle we've managed to make bedtime so consistent.

Currently we either... rock/carry him to sleep, nap in the carseat (this is the quickest way he falls asleep - for example sometimes he'll fight the second nap for an hour then we start to drive him and he falls asleep within minutes), or push him back and forth in a wheeled bassinet and then transfer to crib after he falls asleep. Usually a putdown will take 20-25 minutes of that, but sometimes it can take an hour. All of which are way faster than it was a couple months ago. He's usually crawling/standing/bouncing most of that time, we often have to set him back down a few times and about half the time he takes a paci to calm down when upset during that, but usually removes it himself once he calms down and before he falls asleep (haha!)

Our main goal is to get him to fall asleep independently. We're spending so much time each day trying to get him to fall asleep. In an ideal world, he'd develop a consistent wake up time and drop the night wake-ups. After weeks of work getting to a consistent bedtime, we've got that and think it might be time to try CIO. (We did a shh/pat thing around 5 months with a consultant and he never really got to actually falling asleep independently and he was crying and upset for it all anyway so we eventually started to intervene more and more). We're also suspicious that ferber would just make him more frustrated -- he doesn't calm down easily.

We're planning to:

\- Start this on a day when he's had a decent amount of nap sleep, so he's on as close to a regular schedule as he has...  
\- Do the usual bedtime routine, but a bit later in the day so that we're setting him down in crib at 8:20 which is when he's been falling asleep, not at 7:55 when we've been starting the bassinet rolling. Tell him goodnight and leave the room.   
\- Not intervene even though we expect he's going to start yelling, start standing up in crib and then start some serious upset crying :(. He's pretty stubborn so we're anxious this could be a long time. We sort of tried one night of ferber a couple months ago and gave up at 45 minutes, but he wasn't anywhere near a stable bedtime at that point.  
\- If he has a night wakeup before 5:30, leave him to CIO again. Hope this doesn't happen much.  
\- Once we make it to 5:30am, call it a success and figure out a early wakeup plan once he can sleep independently.  


Questions - does this sound right? Any tips? Words of wisdom? Should we try to CIO naps at the same time? - I'm worried about that since his naps don't have the same consistent putdown times like bedtime does and sometimes even with help it takes him soo long to fall asleep...",Feedback on CIO plan for 10mo?,1671567686.0

After he turned 12 months he started having night wakings and split nights. Prior to this he was sleep trained with pick up put down method. Was sleeping through the night great. Then it all went to crap. I originally thought it was 12 month sleep regression and molars. Then after a month of split nights every night, I thought he may need to drop to one nap. So we did that. He was already almost skipping the 2nd nap anyway which was about 30-45 min, 1st nap being 1 hour and half or 1 hour and 45 min. When he went to 1 nap at about 13 months he was waking up around 8/8:30, 5/5 or 5/5.5 wake windows, asleep by 8:30/9. However, we still struggle with split nights just about every night. Awake for 2-3 hours. I’ve tried moving awake time and bedtime up a lil but can’t be consistent with it because the split nights throw off his sleep so much. We even put him in his room (he slept in his crib in our room prior) to try to help the situation. Still no avail. I’ve tried playing with wake windows, making them shorter or longer, accessing overall daytime sleep and such. He’s had a few nights where he’ll wake up crying, I go in to reassure him, and he falls asleep in 5 min. When I go in I keep the lights off, don’t take him out of the crib, and don’t make a sound. Just reassure him with patting or holding his hand when he cries. He falls asleep on his own in his crib after i rock him for 5 min or so. However I don’t rock him until he falls asleep…and still has the ability to put himself back to sleep (I’ve watched him on the monitor wake up and go back to sleep without me going in), so it doesn’t seem to be a sleep training issue to me. It’s just when he wakes up, he just is awake, and can’t fall back to sleep. Sometimes he doesn’t wake up crying, and he wakes up playful and happy.

For a couple of weeks, he’d only wake at 10pm and we’d feed him and he’d fall back to sleep quite quickly until 6-8am. 

We then started putting him upstairs to nap during the day (instead of downstairs in a swing) and since around then he’s also started waking once between 2am and 5am and he won’t settle until he’s fed.

For context, before the regression he would sleep 7pm - anywhere between 12:30-2, then have a bottle, then sleep until 5:30-7. He always went down easy and never needed soothing or rocking to sleep. He is bottle fed and gets a lot of food during the day, so we got the ok from the pediatrician to start weaning him from his night feed, which we did slowly over the course of a few weeks.

When the regression started, he was all of a sudden waking up every hour across the night. After 4 nights of this we got started on the Sleep Wave. 

At first it went as expected. Night 1 cried for an hour and a half, night 2 45 mins, night 3 20 mins. By night 4 he slept an 11 hour stretch and did so for about 5 nights in a row.

883,sleeptrain,"So we did our first night of sleep training last night (after trying and failing-our fault) 2 weeks ago. 

We spent the time since our last attempt working on nap timing and bedtime routine.

So our night went like this:

Bedtime routine 6.30-7ish

Bb cried for 20 min then fell asleep.

Woke up around 8.30 but put himself to sleep in about a minute (we left him alone)

Woke up at 11.00, cried for 1 hour. I fed him as we figured he was hungry. He had a good 20 min feed.

12.00 cried to sleep (6 min)

Woke up at 4.00 (not crying) I fed him for about 10-15 min then he cried himself to sleep (4 min!!)

So I have 2 questions:

1. Should we have fed him at 12 after he cried for an hour or did that undo some of our work? He previously has gone 10 hours max without a feed (normally 8 hrs before regression) and what should I do tonight? Feed him at 11? Feed at 12? Wait until it's been 8 hrs?.

2. I fed him at 4 to show him that he can get milk without crying. Should I have just left him until he cried or went back to sleep?

Currently she is being rocked to sleep and occasionally we use the dummy when she is really really drowsy in the crib.  

We’ve noticed however that she will almost instantly roll over onto her tummy when she is crying in the crib and doesn’t yet know how to roll back onto her back. We give her lots of floor time during the day to try to encourage her to learn how to roll back but mostly she just gets frustrated and face plants onto the mat and cries even more. 

We wanted to seek some advice as to what we should do in regards to her rolling over when we are sleep training. Do we leave her on her tummy during check ins (even if she’s looking frustrated that she’s stuck in that position)? Do we turn her back onto her back if she keeps rolling onto her tummy?

889,sleeptrain,"Alright... My 9 month old is going through the dreaded separation anxiety.

I know it's separation anxiety because it's only at night (naps have not been interrupted... yet) and she is fine (freshly changed, room is comfortable, not teething, etc.). She used to be a phenomenal sleeper but the last week has been absolute hell. Like, worse than the newborn phase.

She protested sleep until 1:30 in the morning. It took everything in me not to get in my car and drive far, far away and never look back. (I'm only joking, but did my mind go there? Absolutely.) Nothing worked, and believe me - we tried everything. Holding her. Laying her down next to us on our bed. Shushing her. Patting her butt. Rubbing her back. Staying beside the play yard. Leaving her alone to cry. We've tried a few different things over the week but I feel like nothing is sticking. And as for her schedule, I really don't think that needs adjusting. I've tried putting her down earlier, later... I'm completely at a loss. She literally is just protesting sleep because she wants to be with us.

The only thing that has remotely worked that past week was a little crib soother (a light up musical apparatus) and I thought I had figured this all out but that didn't work last night. Damn.

And I'd let her cry it out, but any time I have tried that she cries to the point of hyperventilating and then passes out from exhaustion only to wake up even ANGRIER an hour later. That is not the answer, in my opinion, at least with her. (And I'm totally not bashing CIO, just saying that she is not taking to it and I don't want to keep trying it because it only ramps up my anxiety with this whole thing)

The only advice I can find on the internet is to be consistent with bedtime routine (yep. Again, she's always been a good sleeper. I have changed nothing about her routine), be consistent in how you manage the wakings (easier said than done when nothing seems to help), give her a lovey (uh, she's less than a year old. Isn't that a SIDS hazard??) and then some conflicting advice like ""spend lots of time with her during the day so that she doesn't miss you at night"" but also ""don't hover around your baby. Get them used to not having you around"".

The most terrifying thing I read is that this could potentially subside, oh, somewhere around 2 YEARS.

2 YEEEEARS?! Why isn't anyone talking about this?? Am I really the only parent dealing with this severity of separation anxiety?

And as far as I can tell, there are no reddit posts online with any good advice on this aside from ""it's just a phase. This too shall pass""...

890,sleeptrain,"Not exactly a classic ""sleep training"" question but I'm hoping some pro-sleep parents here can help me figure this out...

My 11 month baby used to sleep 7:30pm to 7:30am with 2-3 hours of naps during the day. Over the last month that has stopped working (he wakes up A TON during the night) and so we've come to the conclusion that we're simply expecting too much sleep from him. He has already been sleep trained and night weaned. We know that he's not waking up from teething (he just finished a round of that, and we can tell the difference between pain cries and normal cries). As far as we know he has nothing else medically that would cause night waking, like ear infections or reflux.

We're trying to shift his schedule to 8:30pm to 6:30am as per recommendations from various books/people. That would leave him with 10 hours of nighttime sleep and 2-3 hours of daytime sleep, for a total of 12-13 hours, which should be about right for his age (instead of the previous 14-15 hours which supposedly is alot for his age).

We've done this new schedule for 2 nights so far. The first night it worked much more than we expected: We kept him up till 8:30pm and he slept fairly well the whole night with minimal fussing/waking and then woke up on his own at 6:30am, right on schedule. The following day we let him have two 1.5 hour naps during the day, one at 9:30am and one at 2:30pm. Both naps he slept the full hour and a half and woke up easily when we came into the room afterwards. He was very tired before both of the naps, which makes sense because his wake windows are being extended with this new schedule.

However last night was almost back to ""normal"": He woke up a lot between 12 and 3, which is pretty much what he had done before this new schedule.

They're currently visiting family and he's begun waking hysterically quite frequently at night, and she's the only one able to respond so she's dying from exhaustion. Y'all have given me some great advice in the past so she wanted to see if she could share her schedule and see if y'all have any ideas for her baby too.  


""At around 4 months we used some SWAP methods (from Precious Little Sleep book) and our baby started falling asleep independently at the beginning of each night. He'd wake to eat 2-3 times and if there was another wakeup, giving him a pacifier and patting him would get him to go back to sleep. He's a chronically short napper and only naps between 30-40 min but he was falling asleep independently for most of those as well (the last nap of the day often needed more help).

However a couple weeks ago he started waking up more in the night and the paci/pats no longer put him back to sleep. He just wants the boob (but isn't obviously hungry, just soothing). We are currently at my parents house for the holidays and his sleep has just gotten worse since then. Over the last week of being here he wakes every 1-2 hours, and won't be settled unless he gets the boob. He's had periods of over an hour long where he cries unconsolably and even picking him to cuddle with him won't soothe him. And now he refuses to even go down for a nap unless I cuddle him to sleep first - and then he complains when I transfer to the crib though he's tired enough that he falls back asleep. I feel like I've been following all of the advice, but I'm not sure what to do and no one is getting enough sleep. SLIP just isn't an option while we're here for the holidays. 

Routine below, though the timing is pretty inconsistent since his sleep has been so bad (sometimes he's up at 4am and sometimes 7am):

Bedtime between 7-7:30. We do nurse, bath, massage, book, song then bed. He's always awake for 2-2.5 hours before bed.

He takes 4-5 \~30 min naps a day with 1.5-2 hr wake windows. I don't nurse him to sleep for naps.

We read “The Happy Sleeper” and plan to implement their “sleep waves” (just putting baby to bed awake and coming in every 5 minutes while they cry to tell them you’re still there). I am so nervous and have a few questions the book didn’t answer:

1) it says baby may cry for 30-60 minutes before falling asleep. What if that just… doesn’t happen? Should we give up after 75 or 90 minutes? This babe has never ever put himself to sleep. 

2) currently we use a yoga ball to bounce baby to sleep. Should we go cold turkey on the yoga ball, or continue to incorporate a short bounce and a lullaby in the bedtime routine, before putting baby to bed awake?

3) Baby has a few different caregivers during the day. If everyone follows the same routine for naps will we be ok, or should we wait until mom & dad can be around a few days in a row before we start?

4) We room share with baby. The book I read said this makes things more challenging - any tips to navigate this? We’re in a one bedroom so moving baby to his own room isn’t an option but we could sleep on a pullout in the living room for a couple nights if that would help. 

5) Baby still feeds once or twice overnight. Will it confuse him that sometimes when he wakes he gets a feed, and sometimes he’s expected to self soothe? Anything to make this better on him? 

Edit: 6) Baby’s been sleeping in a Merlin suit for a month or so. He can still reach his hands to his mouth but would a regular sleep sack be better at this point to give him the full range of his self soothing tools?

So here’s our routine: 
- baby falls asleep between 8 to 8:30 PM pretty easily. Usually requires his blanket and pacifier to fall asleep, no rocking just some shushing and white noise machine.
- Around 1 to 2 AM baby will wake up for a feed. 
- Baby will then sleep until 3 or 4 AM, after which he will start waking up pretty much every half hour to every hour until he finally wakes up around 730 or 8 AM. 

The constant waking up is driving me crazy. He sleeps in the same room as us, but in his separate crib, and when he does wake up, he will fuss and moan, slam his legs, wriggle, and eventually start crying until I get up and either soothe him, or pop the pacifier back in his mouth, after which he will fall back asleep.

904,sleeptrain,"We’ve been doing a deliberate night-weaning-push for the last week and a half. We’re going from nursing every hour or two, now aiming to get to at least every 3hrs, ultimately hoping that’ll pave the way for 4hrs or more. 

Day nurses were also every hour or two, but with lots of targeted distractions we’re already falling into a nice routine with nurses every 3.5 to 4hrs. She’s still not thrilled about it, but I’m hoping her metabolism/physiology adjusts soon and the routine becomes less high-maintenance. 

Does anyone have any data on how long a baby’s metabolism might take to re-regulate after a big timing shift? I’m nursing her at the same times every day on this new regime, and I’m hoping that’ll help regulate her hunger hormones. 

We've had issues with milk supply and latch mechanics in the past, but I think those are resolved now. (She’s also been allergic to every formula I’ve tried. Solids are coming along, but not reliable yet.) 

I’m really hopeful that this is all a plea for comforting more than food, but I’m not sure how to address that effectively if it is.

When we started the night-weaning push, I went in aiming to push her existing routine nurses by about 15mins every night for a month, ultimately leaving just one in the middle of the night and one in early morning. (That's down from about six overnight nurses.) Our previous routine when she cried involved lots of trying to soothe-in-place in her crib (in my room). In the night-weaning push, I abandoned that, expecting a big fight and hoping to ease the way with distractions. Instead of in-place soothing when she cried, I immediately picked her up and started walking the length of the room. This mellowed her right out, and after a minute or two I put her back down and she conked right out… for another couple of hours!! For almost a week, we were skipping overnight nurses all over the place! We started finding a bit of a routine, nursing only at 12am and 4am. That was wild. Then she started resisting being put back in her crib… Now after a few days of that, it’s just getting worse and worse, and I’m spending at least an hour every night with a screaming baby who won’t let me put her down, and apparently just wants to be nursed back to sleep. I haven’t done it yet. I’m looking for a better plan. 

Baby is VERY clingy in general. Nobody else is allowed to hold her, with the occasional and very conditional exception of Dad. It helps a ton if I’m out of sight and out of earshot. If I sneak away to take a video call upstairs, she and Dad can be having a blast, and then I’ll hear her start screaming when she hears me speak, even with a low voice behind a closed door. She’ll often cry if I go to step away from her, even if she was happily playing a minute ago, and I just leaned away to grab something nearby. 

She’s also very mobile and happy to wander off and explore her world. Our whole main floor is baby-proofed so she can just putter, and she will. I’ll plonk her down, and she’ll scuttle away behind furniture and around corners, seeking out precious dog hairs to snack on. I’ve taken her to play groups at libraries she’s never been to before, plonked her down in a room she’s never seen with strangers all around, and she’ll immediately scuttle off to go pull people’s shoelaces and slobber on unfamiliar toys. It blows my mind. 

Back to “resisting being put back in the crib”… We had one good week, then baby started fighting being put back in her crib after a nice mid-night comfort walk. She also got a bit clingier during the day. “Fighting” in this case means heavy crying angry-screaming, starting from the instant I lean over to put her back into her crib, and continuing through any and all attempts to soother her in-place in the crib. Walking with Dad elicits the same screaming and fighting. 

I seem to be able to walk her peacefully until we get to the next “acceptable” nurse window, which is fine for 15mins, but is total crap when she’s waking up an hour early. I’ve abandoned the 12am and 4am thing and am just aiming for distributing nurses apart by 4/3/3/3hrs, so 7pm bedtime nurse, 11pm first night-nurse, then 2am, 5am, (7am we “wake”), 8am morning nurse. 

We tried cry-it-out a couple months ago, and it was awful. She seemed to get better for a couple days, then just kept getting worse until we abandoned it after one week. That was brutal. 

I’m worried about possibly losing her trust, or damaging our attachment. (The family I grew up in was significantly abusive, and I’ve fought my whole life to break that cycle.) 

I’m starting to consider another round of CIO (in her own room), but I’m so scared. I know she can go longer without nursing - she’s not even acting particularly hungry if I nurse her early. She’s also obviously asking for more comforting. I’m feeling so stuck because I have no idea how to actually satisfy that. I’ve walked her so much, and she just screams when I put her down, seemingly no matter what. 

We’ve done co-sleeping in the past, which was convenient for night-nursing, and so lovely for the cuddles, but she’s too light a sleeper. She’s noticeably happier during the day now that she’s consistently in her crib (or stroller for tough naps). 

I don’t want to push her away when she’s asking for more comforting, but my husband makes good points about how she would probably think to self-soothe more if she wasn’t looking right at me and fixating on calling for me to do comforting things. She genuinely seems to do well when I’m not in range to be clung to. And I want to comfort her through this hard new thing I’m putting her through! But there doesn’t seem to be an attainable upward limit on how much “comforting” she’ll expect. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR

* Until now, 10-month-old nursed every hour or two, night and day. 
* Night-weaning went REALLY WELL for 6 days. Now baby is refusing to go back into the crib without a nurse first. 
* Pushing nurses during the day requires deliberate distractions during the last hour, but we’re getting 3.5-4hr-spacing between day-nurses with less and less trouble. 
* Baby is very clingy in general, but still confident enough to explore on her own. 
* I’m scared of damaging her of hurting her trust in me. 

&#x200B;

Questions: 

* How long should it take for metabolism/hunger to adjust? 
* Does she genuinely need more comfort? She is doing a very hard thing! 
   * Is there some precedent for babies in this boat eventually feeling “full” and ready to be more resilient on their own again? 
* Is there some way though this without cry-it-out? 
   * If you think “no”, what’s your reasoning? 
* How the heck do I balance attachment vs independence? 
   * I know studying babies is hard but do any doctors or philosophers out there have anything but pure conjecture to stand on?",Trying to night-wean a very clingy 10-month-old who's used to nursing every hour or two.,1671468682.0
905,sleeptrain," So my 7 month old has never slept for more than a couple hours since he was born. We nurse to sleep and co-sleep. Typically I will nurse him to sleep then lay him in his crib for naps and at the start of the night but it usually turns into a long up and down of putting him back to sleep over and over and over and repeat. Like crying the second he realizes he's been put down. Super light sleeper any small noise and he's up. Usually ends up being a contact nap or a very short >30 minute nap. 
 At night he will nurse All. Night. Long. Most nights since he was a newborn I will have to hold him all night for him to sleep because he had bad painful reflux but i think it became more of a crutch for him. He will wake up crying constantly looking for boob, like every 20 minutes. Sometimes he will not stop nursing all night. 
 Anyways I decided I've had enough as my oldest daughter (6) woke up every 1-2 hours for 2+ years from the time she was born and also nursed all hours of the night and her sleep issues tore me apart and destroyed every fiber of my being for 4 straight years not even exaggerating. SO I just reminded myself i can't go through that again. She is 6 and still getting in our bed and we are still struggling with her. 
I did Ferber with my middle daughter and she is a champion sleeper. A dream since 4 months old. 
 We tried pick up put down with him but bending over his crib for an hour shushing and patting  was just not working for me and my back. Plus he would just wake up again anyways. After researching sleep training methods for hours every night for 2 weeks and reading every single forum on the internet i finally decided to go for it. I started Ferber last night, we did our routine, a bath, added in some play time to get him sleepy, a baby massage, nursed before books this time instead of nursing to sleep. Then books. Told him Good night and laid him down. TEARS. He was mad. I wasn't exact on my times. I probably started at 5 minutes. Then 10. If he sounded really upset i would go again. He just stood there screaming. I laid him down and comforted him and he would get pissed. It was very hard. After nearly an hour of this *i did give in. I decided we'll try again tomorrow. I picked him up. I didn't nurse him, just held him. He went right to sleep in less than 2 minutes, he was just so tired. So initially i thought we failed. BUT THEN! He woke up an hour later, we let him cry for 10 minutes. Then he just magically stopped. Crawled around his crib for a bit? Then laid down and went to sleep. My mind was BLOWN. Like i actually had tears i couldn't believe it lol. He slept from 8-9 and then 9-12 which i then went in and did a dream feed and was able to put him right back down. He woke up one more time around 2, whined for a bit then put himself back to sleep and slept till 4. I went in and fed him, put him back down and he slept until 7! So he slept for a solid 11 hours in his crib!! I can't believe it! I didn't think this was something he could do. Especially not putting himself to sleep like that.

Night waking also reduced significantly at this time for about a month until it all went to shit. She is also able to at times settle herself to sleep in the night.

911,sleeptrain,"Some context about our baby:

* 5 months old
* Sleep 4 to 5 naps per day, each between 35 minutes and 1h, with the afternoon nap averaging 1h30 for approximate average of 4h-4h30 nap total per day. We're not following any nap schedule, just going with sleep cues (otherwise he's very hard to put down).
* Perform the same bedtime routine everyday approximately 1h after his last nap, between 6:15 and 7:30PM.
* We aim for 7:30 PM to 7:30AM sleep. Baby sleep in a pitch black room and we only open the shades at 7:30AM.
* Sleeps with his pacifier and is only fed via nursing
* Overall, baby's mood is awesome during the day 

The sleep of our baby has been getting worst every weeks since he's 3.5 month old. He used to only wake up every 3 to 4h to nurse to then quickly fall back to sleep. This may not be ideal for some parents but was good enough for us! Then sleep regression hit us like a train, he started being extremely agitated in his sleep, wake-up every 1h to 2h and no longer be able to sleep past 4AM without co-sleeping.

We're doing our possible to reduce nursing association by nursing him at the beginning of the sleep routines and removing him from the breast as soon as he slows down during night. We are also trying to put him to sleep drowsy rather than in deep sleep, which make him in a very light agitated sleep where we need to hold his arm otherwise he just rub his eye, pull his pacifier and wake up screaming.

We've tried weaning off his pacifier but we are incapable unless he's put to sleep nursing. He just furiously cry and won't fall asleep without it. Most of the time he end up losing it during his sleep, which is not instantly a problem, but probably not helping the wake-ups...

Since he is 3.5m old, he is incapable of falling asleep on his own. The only way we are capable of putting him to sleep (other than nursing) is to put him in a baby carrier or bounce him on a yoga ball with is eyes covered. Recently, most of the nights we can't even put him to sleep at night by bouncing him, he gets furious and the only option become nursing.

We are not comfortable using CIO methods but we are getting miserably exhausted...

* We read all the time that formula fed babies sleep better. Would switching entirely to formula help weaning the nursing association?
* Is there any pacifier weaning method that worked for you?
* Do you have any no-cry method that you would advise us to try?

913,sleeptrain,"Let’s play a little game of sleep detective. Can you crack my daughters code?Need tips on where to start, what to change, and suggestions on what my little one might need.

Important information about the cute, but large for her age, suspect that should be noted:

1. Suspect in question is combo fed. We struggle a little bit with breast-feeding and rely on formula to supplement. My concern is she’s not getting enough food during nursing sessions in the middle of the night.

2. Suspect just turned 12 weeks. She started to roll back to tummy between 9 to 10 weeks. This has happened a few times she cannot roll the other way. Swaddling has now stopped, which I think is contributing to sleep changes.

3. Suspect is a mommy’s girl. She is a big fan of contact napping which consistently range from an hour and a half to two hours. She receives approximately four naps a day, If she is napping elsewhere such as her crib or stroller. It will only last 20-40mins (Her wake windows seem to also range from 1.5-2hrs). 

4. Suspects Daddy was in and out of hospital last two weeks and on the mend. Mom is temporarily riding solo. 

The problem:
Our sleep has significantly decreased this last couple weeks. I try to keep my routine the same. We feed, play, minimize the stimulants, get put into our sleep sack, rocked in arms , transferred to bassinet and sleep.

After gaining back the weight lost after birth, for about 6weeks we were receiving 4hr sleeps, repeating our eat, play, sleep cycle once in the middle of the night (took anywhere from 1-2hrs)and then receiving another 4-5hrs before we started our day. Sometimes suspect would stretch it to 6. Slowly I stopped doing that and incorporated a night time nurse instead of going through the whole wake window. It worked for a while and we felt blessed. However, all good things come to an end lol.

The last two weeks the longest stretch we get is 3-3.5hrs starting at 9pm. Suspect is up every hour after that from nursing. She nurses for about 5 to 10 minutes and then falls asleep. I am not able to fall back asleep during that time.The only way she’ll give me a longer stretch is if she’s in my arms. I’m wondering if she’s not getting enough milk, and/or lack of swaddle and strong startle reflex are waking her. I’ve tried going back to original middle of the night wake window but it doesn’t make a difference . After the initial 3 hrs, she’s back to hourly wake ups.

What should I try next ? Willing to change up my routine completely if needed. I am not functioning off of 3hrs a sleep a night and I don’t nap throughout the day .

My daughter will be 8 months old in 4 days. She is my second and I thought that I knew a lot about sleep, wake windows, naps, schedules and so on because I have literally spent over 100 hours reading about such things when my first one was little.

But I really don't know how to move forward with my baby's sleep right now, so hopefully someone here has some magic insights for me.

When she turned 7 months I started to move her to a 2 nap schedule because her naps were always only 35 minutes long and I hoped that the naps would elongate with longer wake windows. I slowly pushed her wake windows to 3/3/3.5 over the course of 3 weeks and she seemed to be doing good with that at first. Naps did indeed get longer but then slowly over the last week or so everything has turned to shit.

Schedule before:

5:48 am WU

6:00 OOC

9:00-10:15 nap 1

1:15-2:30 nap 2

6:00 pm bedtime

While she always had an early wake up of 6 am, she also went to bed early and it was working for us. She slept 12 hours at night and 2.5 hours in naps and was happy during her wake times.

Then her wake ups got earlier. First it was 5:45, then 5:30, then 5:00 and today it was 4:55. She did never go back to sleep with feeding or rocking.

So two days ago I thought I might have to scale back her awake times again because the early waking seemed to indicate her being overtired. I did 2.75/3/3.25 and she did well, but crashed for a bedtime of 5:15 and woke at 5:00 am yesterday morning.

Then yesterday she made the first wake window of 2.75 and slept for one hour. But then things got crazy. After 2.5 hours I had to put her down for nap number 2 because she was absolutely done with being awake, red watery eyes, punching her eyes, pulling her ears. She napped for 45 minutes so I had to do a 3 nap day for the first time in 3 weeks. The next awake time lastet only 2 hours! She napped for 1 hour 15. Then she only made it 1.75 hours and fell asleep exhausted at 6 pm.

What is going on!?!

Up this morning at 4:55, slept again from 5:30 to 6:00 with constant patting of the back. OOC 6:00. Constant whining for 1.5 hours. I cuddled her and rocked her a bit to get her to calm down and she fell asleep in my arms at 7:30 after only 1.5 hours of awake time! Slept for 15 minutes in my arms, put her down in the crib, slept another 15 minutes there, woke up screaming, rocked her to sleep and she slept another 15 minutes in my arms.

This is absolutely ridiculous, what should I do? Did anyone ever go back to 3 naps at 8 months? Obviously I can't do early bedtime to help with the OT because her bedtime already is crazy early or I would have to put her to bed at 4 pm.

Her first two teeth have been visible in the gums for 2 months but won't come through. I occasionaly give her pain relieve when she seems to be in pain from teething but I don't really see a difference in her sleep when I do vs. when I don't.

Sometimes a second wake around 5 but making it a good 6-8 hours of solid sleep. Then 5.5 hit and she’s now sleeping so terribly again the past few weeks. I don’t know what to do as she’s sleep trained already and still goes to bed independently really well. Sleep training night wake ups has never worked as she would just cry for hours with no letting up so that’s not really an option as I’m not comfortable with that. 

She wakes around 630 for the day and her wake windows are 2/2.5/2.5/3 and butt in bed between 7-715 (falling asleep within 5-10 mins).

926,sleeptrain," Our son is 21w actual / 14w adjusted and is not yet sleep trained. I try to follow his cues and wake windows throughout the day, but it all falls apart by the evening. The first three naps of the day go well, but the fourth nap and especially bedtime is a big struggle. We’ve been practicing putting down drowsy but awake on the first three naps and it’s working, but it’s impossible to do so for the fourth nap and bedtime because he cries quite a bit when we try to put him down.

Here’s what a typical day looks like:

7:30 wake up

\~9-10 1st nap (usually 40mins - 1hr)

\~11:30-1:30 2nd nap (usually 1.5-2hrs. He’s unable to connect sleep cycles, so we usually help him get back to sleep midway.)

\~3-4 3rd nap (usually 40mins - 1hr)

\~5:50-6:30 4th nap (try to cap length to < 40mins) — Huckleberry predicts this nap should happen at 5:30

\~9:30 Bedtime — Huckleberry predicts bedtime at 8:30

With this schedule, trying to get him to sleep with all our usual aids (white noise, blackout curtains, sleep sack) as well as rocking/singing/shushing doesn’t go well at all in the evenings — he cries a ton and basically exhausts himself to sleep. At this stage, my goal is just for him to sleep without a fight before we can move on to independent sleep.

I’m not sure if we should try to drop the 4th nap and bump up bedtime or increase the awake time after 3rd and 4th nap or try something else. I have a much harder time reading his tired cues in the evening, so I’m not sure if I’m missing them and he’s overtired or if maybe he’s undertired from too much daytime sleep.

931,sleeptrain,"I just got back from a week long trip with my 4.5 month old LO. I thought I would share some of my experiences since a lot of people are traveling this time of year.

The situation:
- Traveled by plane 
- Destination is 2 hours behind home time. We stayed in home time and did not try to do a time change 
- LO is 20 weeks and sleep trained for night at 16 weeks
- At home 1st nap is fully independent, 2nd nap starts in crib and I often help extend, 3rd nap is contact
- Bedtime is 8pm and DWT is 7am
- Stayed in a hotel. LO slept in the bathroom in a hotel mini crib
- Brought bedtime routine items from home. This includes white noise, sleep sack, books, lotion, diapers, and diaper cream

Travel Days:
- The flight from home to the destination went well. LO was well rested and we were able to loosely stay on our typical nap schedule.
- Naps on the plane suuuuucckk. LO was able to get to sleep but announcements or other exciting happens made it hard to get anything longer than a 30-45 min rest. If possible, I would try to get a decent nap in before heading to the airport (this wasn’t for us).
- The return flight was a mess. LO was tired from the week and crash napped several times. 
- The flight to the destination arrived with enough time to get LO to bed. 
- Our return flight was late so we got home about 30 min after bedtime. I tried to extend a nap to help make the difference but it didn’t work. LO was pretty miserable so we did a shortened bedtime routine and got her in the crib.

Naps:
- I did whatever I could to get a nap on the plane. This includes nursing, rocking, and cuddling to sleep.
- We tried to keep the first nap independent while on vacation. This nap was typically much shorter than at home (30 vs 60 min).
- Naps 2 and 3 on vacation were often contact. We struggled to get the same nap lengths as home.

Nights:
- We made sure LO fell asleep independently at bedtime.
- We experienced way more night wakings than at home. We tried to help nurse or rock LO to sleep this resulted in some extended bedtime crying. We essentially had to retrain for one night in the hotel.

Now that we are home:
- We are back to our normal routine.
- I’m focusing on getting quality naps this week so LO can recover.
- We had some overtired crying our first night back home but the night was overall normal.

What I learned:
- Sleep outside of familiar places is difficult. Expect crap naps and more night wakings.
- The first day or two went well but sleep got harder as the week progressed.
- Consistency is key but difficult to achieve. You may have to do some retraining.
- Hotel cribs suck, bring a pack n play.
- Staying in home time was a good move.

We had been on a pretty solid 3 naps schedule with a long contact nap as his 2nd nap, and he was transferred to his crib after being fed or rocked to sleep for his 1st and 3rd. Those naps he would only sleep 30 minutes, but when I held him for his second nap, he would connect sleep cycles and sleep for 1.5-2 hours.

After he turned 6 months I decided it was time for him to fall asleep independently for naps. The first day was hard but that was it… he now goes down completely awake after a short nap routine with minimal fuss! I was amazed. Problem- 75% of the time he still has 30 minute naps. I’ll leave him for crib hour but he will just play quietly or scream. He has connected sleep cycles a handful of times, which is progress, but I thought as soon as he learned to fall asleep independently that would fix the short nap problem. That hasn’t been the case, at least yet. 

I had been rescuing the second nap once he woke up if both naps were short, and I thought maybe that was contributing to the problem. However, not only has that not taught him to connect cycles, he now has 2 crib hours where he’s upset and he is only getting 1.5 hours of nap sleep a day, which has led to split nights. Ugh.

I’m sure there’s a schedule issue, but I’ve tried both lengthening and shortening the wake windows and trying to recreate the days when he does do those longer naps with no luck.

My main questions:
1. Is the move to try and shorten wake windows? Or is he old enough that I should lengthen them and try for a 2 nap schedule?
2. What do I do if both naps (or the first 2) end up being 30 minutes? Ok to rescue the second one? I don’t know what else to do to prevent him from getting overtired and having these split nights.

944,sleeptrain,"We originally sleep trained our daughter (7m) 3.5 weeks ago using Ferber. Prior to sleep training she was waking 1-2x per night to nurse. Sleep training came with accidental night weaning, since we made a rule to only feed her if she woke after her usual feeding time of 2am, and that only happened four times in the first two weeks after training. We had two beautiful nights of sleep, with 0-1 wake-up per night.

A week and a half ago she started teething. She was waking up screaming, no way she was going to self soothe, and very hard for us to soothe. So I nursed her through her 2-3x nightly wake-ups. As of yesterday, the two teeth she was working on are now through the gum line. She still woke up twice last night, and even though she wasn't as frantic with her crying I nursed her because I'm unsure about suddenly removing these feeds again, even though I know she can go without them since she has before.

Any advice for night weaning and then re-training her to self-soothe through these wake-ups? She's falling asleep very well at night, her eyes close as soon as her sound machine turns on/before I even get the lights off. She is also napping well (falls asleep fast for 1&2), though times are variable with daycare currently. When she's home we roughly follow:

7:30 Wake

9:30-11 Nap 1 (this is sometimes a little longer)

1:15-2:45 Nap 2 (this is sometimes a little shorter)

5:15-5:45 Nap 3

8:30 Bed

On daycare days, naps 1 and 3 typically match home (though nap 1 is usually only about 50 minutes, sometimes even shorter or skipped) and nap 2 is usually much earlier and longer (12:30-2ish)).

Tips for getting back to the great sleep we had the first 2 weeks after sleep training initially? I'm not sure how to go about breaking the middle of the night feeding habit, and she definitely still knows how to fall asleep on her own since she's doing it at the beginning of the night.

ETA: We primarily follow wake windows, so nap times and bedtimes are adjusted based on nap lengths. We do cap the first two naps to two hours individually and 3.5 hours combined, so day sleep is never more than 4 hours.

She struggled with reflux but is now medicated and doing better. We have resorted to bed sharing some time ago (regrettably), so we will be transitioning her the first weekend of January to her crib and nursery with Weissbluth’s method. I have several questions upon reading the book. 
1. I know transitioning from bed sharing to her room and crib will be harder and longer using CIO; can I have opinions on whether or not this stark adjustment will be too difficult for her? Should we put the crib in our room for a week and then move her and do CIO? Our pediatrician says it will be hard regardless and to just move her and sleep train in one go. 
2. Has anyone used CIO and simultaneously stopped using a paci at night? Our girl normally requires the paci to fall asleep initially but shortly thereafter she spits it out. We used to roll over and pop it back in during her night wakings but lately she has been resistant to it anyway and we can’t go back in her room to do this during CIO. Thoughts or advice on this? 
3. What about diaper changes in the night? Normally when she wakes up fully after we have tried soothing her back to sleep, my fiancé will change her diaper and I’ll feed her back to sleep (another habit we are hoping to break with cio). She’s often wet but has never pooped overnight. Do we just leave them with a wet diapey til the am? 
4. I’m having a hard time with naps currently and having her on a schedule. I normally go by wake windows but am seeing people have success with scheduled naps. To me, scheduled naps for my LO seems like they would leave her overtired. How do we navigate naps during sleep training? Sleep train for nights first and then naps later? If so, do I put her to sleep myself for every nap and in the crib? Or in our bed until we train her on naps? 
If I’m to sleep train everything all at once, how do I avoid an extremely sleep deprived and overtired baby so that sleep training is actually set up to be successful? 
5. We tried the Ferber method for exactly 1 night when she was about 3mos (hated it). She squirmed all around the crib and was so wet and sweaty from her crying. We’d had her in the Merlin suit at that time so I expect less sweating this go round (she is in the nested bean sleep sack); is it okay if she gets herself to be diagonal in the crib or in other less desirable positions?

This is a bit worse than normal, and teething may be an explanation as one of his molars breaks through.

For context, right now she takes great 1-2 hour naps falling asleep independently  for them, we follow the huckleberry app which predicts things great except their bedtime suggestion she never looks tired at the suggested time, so we usually give her an additional hourish (they usually suggest 2.5 hr last wake window).

She has slept great long stretches on a 4 hour WW before bed as well as a 2.5 hour WW before bed, so I’m having a hard time figuring out what is best or essentially should I be following her tired cues such as eye rubbing and red eyebrows or follow the wake window for her age.

I THINK it's working well: some of his naps are starting to be as long as an 1/1.5 hrs , up from 30 mins, and I can tell now that he's getting tired around the 1.5 mark. Plus he seems to settle into the naps with less crying. Bedtime is 7/7:30 depending on how long his naps have been during the day with a wake up time of 6am.

Question for those who have done a version of CIO: did you commit fully even when your little one was fully committed to screaming for well over an hour? I’ve seen a lot of people talk about the difficulty of this method and then saw that their little one cried for 20 mins. And I’m not trying to take away from their pain, but I would kill for 20 minutes of crying. As I type this, my child has been crying for 75 minutes.

Have just transitioned to two naps a couple days after it started because my mum is nap training her and she now takes 1-1.25h naps (more likely closer to 1h, so total 2h nap sleep. Previously it was all 30min crap naps so total 1.5h nap sleep)  during the day. So we went cold turkey to 3/3/4-4.5. Wake up is 7am bed time 8pm.

We tried earlier bed time (so 4h awake before bed) but she just would scream until 8pm and then pass out, so I try keep bedtime the same.

She is sleep trained for nights since 6 months and routine is boob, bath, jammies, little walk around the room with a song and bed.

I was thinking
- maybe it's just the transition phase

- or is she undertired (but she is not up playing, she wants to sleep but not in the crib)

- maybe separation anxiety

after about 1h of either walking around with her or sitting in the rocking chair she would eventually go back into the crib.
I tried feeding her in that time, but I can tell she isn't interested, because she just hangs out at the boob and still refuses to go to sleep. So I don't feed her, and feed her upon the next wake up, which is typically around 3/4am.

Pls help make sense of this.",8 months old waking up 3h past bed time,1671309597.0
980,sleeptrain,"Ladies (or gents...), I am at my wits end. I am so tired I can't stand it and I just don't know what to do. I need help, advice, personal experience, anything. As a newborn, my 7mo slept through the night. Then all off a sudden, one day, he just didn't anymore, and it's never been the same.
He falls asleep completely on his own for bedtime and naps. Asleep by 7:45, but after 9:30 he wakes anywhere from every 1hr-3hrs all night until 7am. Crying. Hysterically. He never sleeps a longer stretch than 3 hours. I try every way possible to soothe him other than a bottle or boob, but he will cry and cry until he literally chokes and acts like he can't breathe and starts the double breathing thing. It scares me so bad that I just cave and put him on my boob to make him stop. This is also the only time he gets to breastfeed anymore. He is almost completely weaned. I unlatch him after 3-5 mins, and he fusses for a second, but then falls back asleep.
My first was not like this, so this is all new for me.
I read on a sleep site reasons why night weaning/sleep training isn't working. One of them was ""your baby knows how to fall asleep independently, but the association of nursing to sleep is very strong. He is still waking all night and needing little mini feeds. In these cases, it's likely that your child has a particularly strong association between feeding and sleeping, and that strong association is showing itself at night. The fix here would be to stay very consistent and committed to your night weaning plan, and help soothe your child without feeding to sleep."" This is exactly what's happening. And I realize my issue is probably that I always just cave to what he wants, but I just can't figure out any other way to comfort or soothe him because nothing works. He screams and screams and I'm just at a loss you guys.

981,sleeptrain,"I posted here earlier this week about my 7 month olds short naps and it was suggested that I move him to a 2 nap schedule. His nights have been going relatively well for the last month or so (usually just one wake and he'll sleep 11-11.5 hours total at night). Our ideal schedule would be 7:00 wakeup / 9:30-11:00 nap / 2:00-3:30 nap / 7:30 bedtime.

The first day went relatively well! I didn't jump straight into a 3/3/4 schedule, but did 2.5/2.75/3.5. He had an earlier bedtime that night because he was super tired and barely made it 3.5 hours. 

Since then, I've tried extending his wake windows, but his naps have been mostly short again. Yesterday we did 2.5/3/4 but he was severely overtired and fussy that night. And today his first nap was only 40 min again...

I'm feeling very overwhelmed and anxious right now because it now seems like we are in a cycle of short naps again and now that he's only on 2 naps, if he takes only 40 min naps, that only gets him max 1.5 hours of day sleep and leaves him overtired going into bedtime.

My 21 month old has been sleep trained for almost a year now and night weaned for 6 months. 

Starting about 3 months ago, she would periodically wake up around 2 in the morning, screaming. When I go to check on her, she is fine as soon as I pick her up. When I put her down, she screams again. She will sometimes be up for an hour or more (more if I stay in the room, less if I let her cry). This happens anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week but sometimes we’ll go for a week straight with no night wakings. 

I’ve tried to work out what the problem might be but I’m stumped. Her normal sleep schedule is as follows:

Wake up: 7:00 am 
Nap : 11:30 - 1:30 pm
Bedtime: 7:45 pm

I’ve tried shortening her nap but it doesn’t seem to make any difference besides a crabby baby by the end of the night. Also have tried putting her down later. Again, doesn’t necessarily change the wakings. 

We use blackout curtains, a white noise machine, and a pacifier. I reticent to get rid of the pacifier, especially considering there are many nights where she’s got it in her mouth (while screaming) when I go in there to check on her. 

My other kiddos never had this particular issue so I have no idea how to proceed. 

I’m wondering if it has something to do with how active she is or isn’t during the day. I need to do a better job tracking this but I could see how rainy days or bad weather days where we stay in could be a factor.

989,sleeptrain,"Sleep trained for nights a few weeks ago, and those are going fine. Baby goes to sleep independently at night and wakes up a few times but can resettle on his own. Usually do 1 feed a night.

He has never been a good napper. After sleep training nights we started with the first nap of the day giving him 15 mins to fall asleep on his own (after mini bedtime routine). First time he cried maybe 9 mins and went to sleep for half an hour, rescued the rest of the nap for a full 1.5hrs. Next day put himself to sleep after just a few mins of crying and slept a full hour. We’d been on and off between those two mostly for the past week. Now he cries super hard at the start and will only sleep a couple mins before waking up again screaming. I’ve been having to go rescue pretty much all naps again and having a hard time calming him down enough to fall back asleep and a really hard time getting him back into his crib (for us rescue just involves taking him out of his crib in our room and putting him on our bed and laying beside him til he falls back asleep... and now usually staying like that for the rest of the nap after failed attempts to move back to crib).

I was finally starting to feel like a normal person again not stressing constantly about naps and even getting some free time on my own while he did nap and now it feels like that’s slipping away again so quickly! What am I doing wrong? What changed after a few good days of him napping independently for at least the first nap and lengthening the first two? Not fighting the third, we usually have to wake him.

For context - baby is almost 6.5 months, breastfed, just started solids (going great) and has two teeth coming in (doesn’t really seem to be in pain). He usually gets about 3 hrs nap total per day (sometimes less if they go badly but we cap at 3.25 max). Wake windows are in the range of 2.25/2.5/2.5/2.5-2.75, give or take some.

I have 4.5 month old tough-ish sleeper. 

We have spent a lot of time working on sleep shaping. We have gone from intense bouncing for hours and feed to sleep associations to much improvements using PSL techniques. Now we put baby down 30 minutes after feed at night and he mostly falls asleep independently within 15 minutes with some light fussing. 

However the nights are very unpredictable. Some nights he’ll wake up 10, 1, 4. Other nights he’ll sleep through until 2am. Sometimes he wakes and self settles. Sometimes he wakes and is hysterical. 

No schedules or feeding changes that can explain the differences.

We usually feed twice. Once after 1am and one snooze button feed. If he wakes up before 1am we try to let him FIO and intervene only if necessary. Sometimes he doesn’t wake at all though. 

What could drive the erratic sleep schedule? Any tips? 

It seems like most babies I read about have normal patterns. (Good patterns and bad patterns!! Haha so not necessarily saying that all patterns/habits  are “good”).

I’m about to lose my mind. My 13 month old has always been a terrible sleeper and despite sleep training at 5 months, was never able to string together more than 2-3 hours till almost the 1 year mark. We had a couple weeks of okay sleep, but things have been really rough the last few days with early morning wake ups. He’s been up and ready to go at 4-5 and my husband and I are beyond exhausted. 

As of now, my son naps 2x per day, at around 9 and 2. Each nap is usually 45 minutes to an hour. Bedtime is around 7:30. 

Is it time to transition to 1 nap? I know that this would be the early end of the age range, but he’s always been low sleep needs and a bit ahead of the game with these things. I’m pretty convinced we should transition, but my husband isn’t. 

And if we do transition, how do we go about it? Keeping my poor baby up till 11 or noon sounds like such a stretch when he is waking up at 4:30! But I also don’t know how else to break the cycle.

992,sleeptrain,"I ask myself this question on an hourly basis and my conclusion changes every single time. Would appreciate any thoughts.

- 5 month old
- Bedtime at 7-7:15pm. Goes to sleep independently but protests for 0-3 minutes before falling asleep immediately
- 2 night feedings/diaper change: anytime after 10:30pm and after 2:30am. 30-40 minutes each. Wakes up crying for those.
- He’s getting about 8.5-9.5 hours of nighttime sleep, not including the hour of feedings.
- Often has a few 1-3 minute crying wake-ups between feeds. No intervention unless they last longer than 5 minutes, which is rare.
- Morning wake-up anywhere between 5:15-6:30am (closer to the 5am-hour recently). Happy and playing 75% of the time. Still yawning with drowsy eyes though.
- No matter the wake-up time, try to get to 9am for the first nap. On especially fussy days, I’ll do earlier, though never earlier than 8:30. It’s often a cycle of crying and falling asleep a few times before actually staying asleep.
- All other WW between 2-2.5 hours.
- He often falls asleep when feeding or on a walk, even when it’s only been 1-1.5 hours since the last wake-up. I keep him up to stretch it to a longer WW.
- Daytime sleep capped at ~3 hours, give or take 15 min. Individual naps capped at 2 hours. 2 out of 3 naps per day are contact naps and I have to wake him from those, he’s usually not happy.

Trying to decide now if I should shorten or lengthen daytime sleep to get more nighttime sleep and later morning wake-ups. I know it may be something I just need to attempt for a few days and see, but wanted to get this sub’s opinions first. Otherwise I’d just flip a coin, load up on coffee, and cross my fingers.

My 5 year old has been having daytime accidents about once a week (sometimes more, sometimes less) for quite some time. I never ever shame her or make it a big deal. She says “mommy I peed in my undies” and I usually don’t even look up from what I’m doing I just say “okay, put the wet ones in the laundry tub and grab new ones. Do you need any help?” Or something like that. 

I know it’s because she is stalling going to the bathroom for way too long. Sometimes it’s because she’s so busy playing or doesn’t want to stop what she’s doing. Sometimes it’s at a strange house where she is too nervous to ask where the bathroom is or too nervous to tell strange people she is going. 

I can’t help but think it’s completely my fault. Admittedly I’ve “lost my mommy mojo,” and I’ve not been up to my usual gentle parenting standards. I’ve gotten audibly and visibly frustrated with her for being a normal 5 year old (acting impulsively, only eating junk vs. the healthy meal I prepared, not respecting her younger sister’s (18mo) boundaries, etc).

10,AttachmentParenting,"So we always knew this would be hard. We bought our Bay Area home before our now 3 year old was a Twinkle in our eye. The living space (kitchen , dining, living room ) are upstairs along with a large master suite. Downstairs along with primary entryway, are a full bath , 2 smallish bedrooms (hubs uses one as office) laundry room and utility room/ crawl space.

So daughters room is downstairs. She slept with us in side car till almost a year, then I slept with her in her room after. For a while we did futon on the floor, last year it’s been her and me on the couch in her room made up like a bed. She has a toddler bed but it’s never really been used routinely. I “ninja” away after getting her to sleep and for months it was pretty ok, few night wakeups , I got to wake up in my bed it was amazing. Well the we took the child lock off her door and husband encouraged her to come to our room if she needed it. Well for a week that’s what happened. I started going back down to her a lot but no more was she sleeping though the night a lot. Last few weeks we don’t even end up with more then 3 hours after bed before she’s calling for me. 

Some thing has to give! Hubs suggested just having her sleep in our room for a month to reset. I offered - maybe we switch hubs office and our bedroom! She just turned 3. I think this would make things more sane. She wouldn’t feel so far from us and maybe nighttime wakeups wouldn’t be so hard for her knowing we are so close.

I skipped through the sleep part (duh) but I’m slightly amazed about the delayed gratification pause. 

Has anyone tried anything in this book? I’m interested in the parts about patience and non-picky eating. I used to think US mainstream parenting is apathetic but European sounds even worse (how can they banish children from adult bedrooms?!)

12,AttachmentParenting,"My babe is almost a year old. We nursed exclusively (incl. for comfort), until 7.5 months when I had to suddenly go cold-turkey and turn to formula and pacifiers (long story, neither of us wanted it, but here we are). We still bedshare, and she falls asleep with a bottle at naptime and night (I know it is strongly recommended not to give bottles *in* bed, but going cold-turkey was traumatic to say the least, and the warm bottle is what brings her comfort, other than the warm cuddles and pacifier). We introduced a cup with straw at 6 months for water, so she's pretty good with that now, though she manages to get more water in her by tipping the cup into her mouth, rather than drinking from the straw (thanks to that one time her dad and I genuinely lol'd when she spat the water 2 feet after drinking from the straw).

My question to you folks who have been in similar situations is, how did you wean off bottles at bedtime? Just the idea of doing it is bringing me much anxiety, but I know I have to start now. So I need advice, but without shaming, I beg of you. 

Her bedtime routine is pretty basic. We turn off all the electronics and dim the lights in her play area, and choose some books to read quietly. After changing her diaper and putting on PJs, we go to bed with a pacifier and warm bottle of formula, and lay in bed, snuggled up together. Sometimes she falls asleep right after she finishes the bottle, and sometimes she flops around the bed and babbles, while I calmly return her to a cuddling position over and over until she falls asleep. In dire situations, I pick her up and sway with her while gently singing to her, then try the cuddles again. We have a noise machine that's always going. On nights when we have a bath, we bathe her between dinner and quiet time.

Update: Just tried giving her her usual 4oz wake-up formula snack in the straw-cup, and it was not successful. She spat it out after sipping through the straw (which is also what she does when there is water in it--at this point I'm not convinced she even knows how to swallow after sipping through the straw), and she refused to even open her mouth when tipping the cup into her mouth. I think she's weirded out that there is something other than water in the straw-cup that usually contains water. We'll keep at it, and I'm certain she'll get used to it eventually.

She wakes at least 3 times a night to eat and it’s taking a toll on me physically and mentally. I would be very happy to only wake up once, but any more than that is too much for me. 

For 3 weeks I have been trying to slowly wean off some feeds, but the end result is inconsistent. Last night she was awake on and off from 11-2 while I refused to nurse. My plan was to offer a bottle instead, thinking that I could offer her calories while not ignoring her because I don’t believe in CIO. Whenever I gave her a bottle she would scream even louder and physically push it away. I know she can use a bottle because I’ve given her empty ones to play with and I can hear her sucking for fun. I don’t know how to encourage her to actually drink from them though. We went 6 hours last night without eating and no luck. 

I finally gave up at 2am and nursed. She then woke up at 530 and nursed again. I am at this point getting way less sleep trying to wean at all. She used to wake only once a night when she was 4 months old and it was wonderful. I’d love to get back to that schedule, or even just get her to take a bottle so I can get some breaks.

My in-laws have now offered to take our baby once a week for the night so we can get a full night’s sleep. They live 5 minutes away from us, so it would be a drop off at 8pm and pick up at 7am sort of situation.

I am mostly worried about my baby feeling abandoned, or anxious during the night, but then again I think about the fact that some people who practice AP have a night nurse come every now and then, and this would be better as my baby knows and loves my in-laws. The other worry is whether this will make her sleep even worse, as she won’t feel like she has a “routine?” She doesn’t really sleep in any significant stretches at night though.

Lol) Anyways, it’s been a few weeks of my LO (12.5 months) waking shortly after being put down. In months past, this or split nights was my signal that it’s time to drop a nap. I tried dropping to 1 nap a few days ago, and while it did help his initial first stretch the first night, he was up for HOURS in the middle of the night and then the subsequent nights he was still waking shortly after bedtime and then again for hours in the middle of the night. Needless to say, I am exhausted, stressed, teary, and don’t know how much more I can take. Much like a lot of you in this sub, I was not blessed with a unicorn baby that sleeps without issue. The longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep I’ve gotten was 4 hours and that was one time when he was about 5 months old. So it’s been this way for over a year now. Anyways, to the point. I was joking with my husband today about how I wish I didn’t GAF about screen time and could just stick baby in the pack and play and put some TV on while I nap (no judgement if you do this, we’re all in survival mode at this point). I followed up by telling him even that wouldn’t work because I put Miss Rachel on this morning so I could shower but he screamed the whole time. My husband replied “he definitely has an attachment issue to you”. I asked what he meant by that. He said he just “loves me so much and doesn’t ever want to be put down or away from me”. I wasn’t really sure how to take that. On one hand, I love being my baby’s biggest source of comfort. I love being his safe place. On the other hand, everything I have read about attachment theory would suggest that these are signs of an insecure attachment? Or maybe it’s just the age he’s at? I dunno.

I love my little girl more than anything in the world but she won’t sleep. If any of you have read the Fussy Baby Book by Dr Sears, that is my baby girl to a T. I adore her, she is intelligent and willful and has a big personality, but the chronic lack of sleep is killing me mentally and destroying my body.

My 8 month old baby only sleeps at night when rocked or when sleeping on our chest, will sleep for a maximum of 15 minutes in her crib then wake up. We do shifts but my husband and I are both exhausted beyond belief. Putting her to sleep is also a whole other saga.

We have tried eveything you could suggest. We have tried cosleeping but she cries as much as if when she is in her cot, she only accepts sleeping ON me, so that didn’t help, and I slept even worse so she might as well sleep in her own crib. We tried gentle sleep training methods, although I am not sure you could even call them “training”, just different ways of getting her to settle to sleep but nothing works. As soon as we put her down she is up. We have tried removing me from the equation, to see if she is motivated to wake up by me, and having dad do all the night wakings, we have tried a floor bed, moving her to her own room. We have spent thousands of £ on this and nothing works. Anything you could suggest we have tried.

So if you are a parent of a baby who genuinely didn’t sleep, not someone whose baby woke up every 2-3 hours at this age (I would DIE for every 2-3 hours), but someone whose baby was high needs, a signaller and hard to settle, please tell me there is a light at the end of this.

We went abroad to visit my family for 3 months, since we were kept apart because of covid restrictions. My partner came for one month then left back to our home to get back to work. I stayed with our LO for 2 more months with my parents at their house. Our LO had so much fun! But at that time, right when my partner left, all his molars and then incisors came in one after the other. He was up every hour. The only thing that soothed him was nursing. 

He never was a ""good"" sleeper, but before we left abroad, we got him down to 3-4 wakings a night, one of which my partner did so I could sleep room 9 pm- 1 am or so. Now abroad, it was just me waking every hour to nurse him back to sleep.

Then we got back home and he started daycare. Where he picked up a stomach virus and a respiratory virus.... and you guessed it; he was still teething. 

So we gave him children's advil and tylenol switching between the 2 and that helped. But again nursing every hour or so. Poor guy!! (Poor me, sry for the pity party, I'm so tired). 

Now he's finally better but still waking every hour or two hours and every time he wakes he wants to nurse.

Someone recently posted a similar post about being so ""in it"" with their baby that mothering is their primary identity. I want to second that and say, me too! I was extraordinarily nervous about becoming a mother. I told myself for years that I wasn't a baby person and convinced myself I would be terrible and non-maternal. I was terrified that becoming a mother wouldn't happen for me, and I was protecting myself. Plus, I've had a lot of modeling from parents who don't have the same AP style as me, and I think I was scared I had to fit into the same box. Turns out, nope, I can do my own thing. 

Okay, so now my LO is 11 months, and I have been head over heels in love with him this whole year. When he entered the world, I looked down and thought, ""oh, yes, of course, it was you."" This year has been dream-like. My body is full, full, full of love for this tiny human. His baby breath, his belly, his pure heart, his wonder for the world. All of it is magic. Like there is a song I sing to him called ""there's magic in your bones,"" and it hits deep. 

So, this post is to say that I am so in it with him and who I was before giving birth isn't fully online. Maybe it never will be again. Perhaps I am fundamentally changed. Or perhaps this is a season, and eventually, parts of me, like the yoga-practicing, journey dancing, dedicated to full-time work, and interested in volunteering, parts of myself will come back online. But, like, I'm okay with the right now. I love being ""in it"" with my baby and my spouse. My favorite days are when it's three of us and our dogs, and we go on long walks through the forest, play games, read books, and look at the moon or listen to the rain.

Here is an example, the other day, I had an opportunity to go to a yoga class on a Sunday evening at my former studio. It was a candlelit class, and my community was there, I'm sure, in full force. But it's a 20-minute drive and a 1.5-hour class. I wanted to go in theory, but in reality, nah. It was a sacred Sunday night with my loves. Sacred, sacred, sacred.

But my quandary is that it all feels so sacred right now still. Is that okay? Is it okay to be so swept away? Am I going to drift off? I'm afraid that if I'm not away more now, I will anxiously attach to my baby. I certainly have an anxious attachment style. But, on the other hand, I love it all so much.

The nightly routine was, baby in baby carrier, dim night light,nipple in mouth, bum tapping and walking back and forth for about 10-30 mins depending on sleep pressure, overtirednes, naps. Anyway!
I started laying down and nursing her to sleep and she hated it, so I'd try for about 5 mins and if she yelled toomuxj I would baby carry.

28,AttachmentParenting,"I always hoped to exclusively breastfeed, but it has proven to be a near impossibility for me and my first child. Breastfeeding, like attachment parenting, are the baseline ways to be human and raise a child (I thought). If it’s not broken, don’t fix it; you can’t improve upon Mother Nature, etc.

We had major jaundice at birth and oral tethers which no one in my country will treat, which led to transfer issues and low milk supply. I’ve been pumping 8 times a day and using supplements to boost my supply for four months now. I’ve had times where I’ve made just enough, but I’ve needed to double feed with the pumped milk or triple feed with that and formula to keep my baby gaining any weight.


Props to those who breastfeed more smoothly, or those with low supply who can keep the pumping up for months and months, but I think the amount of anxiety I have about feeding my baby is proving not to be worth it. My whole life is revolving not just around feeding my baby but the anxiety that he is not getting what he needs. The struggles with low supply have really eroded my confidence and my trust in my intuition as a parent. I think I might be a better mother if I reduce some of the pressure and free up energy for playing and actually leaving the house sometimes.

I have loved cosleeping with my son, and felt honored that we were able to nurse (for what it’s been worth). I have so much grief with letting the dream of EBF go. But I think we need to add in formula again because his weight has plateaued with just nursing and pumped milk.

Can I still “attachment parent” without exclusively breastfeeding? I want my child to know I am here with him, but I am scared everything will change once we go more towards bottle feeding. I’m also just feeling sad that my body didn’t cooperate with the natural way of feeding my baby, and am apprehensive that all my parenting ideals will fall by the wayside and because we couldn’t EBF.

29,AttachmentParenting,"I would like some advice please. I’m a first time mom.

My daughter is 12 months old, and I have always nursed her to sleep every single night and every single nap. For the first 8 months she slept in a Next2Me crib in our room, then since she was 8mo she sleeps in a crib in her own room with a baby monitor. 
Over the last few weeks she fights bedtime, she goes down really quickly for her daytime naps (within minutes) but for bedtime it’s always a struggle (recently taking about 1-1.5 hours). I started going in the crib (🫣!!!) with her to cuddle and nurse her to sleep. That worked for a bit but now she will switch between nursing and sucking her thumb and keeps tossing and turning, getting very restless, but doesn’t fall asleep. 
Lately the only thing that works is my husband getting in the crib with her, he cuddles her and she falls asleep within 5 minutes BUT that’s after 5 mins of crying because I’ve left the room. Even if I stay in the room, she still cries because I’m not the one holding her 😢
So now I’m wondering if it’s bad that I leave her to cry even though I know she is being cuddled and loved by her dad. Is this the equivalent to what people do when sleep training and leave their baby to cry. It breaks my heart to hear her crying but I know she’s with her dad and not being neglected. 

Her current Wake windows are:
Wake window 1: 3 hours
Wake window 2: 3.5 hours
Wake window 3: 4-4.5 hours 
She naps for a total of 1h30 each day, either 45minutes each or 30mins and 1 hour or vice versa, never more. She’s always been a cat napper.
Her nighttime sleep averages between 11-11.5 hours

I should also mention that she recently started teething as well, she had no teeth for 12 months and now there’s suddenly 4 coming in at once so I think this could be causing her to have trouble falling asleep but then again I don’t understand why she falls asleep so easily for her daytime naps and never a struggle?

Another thing is when she wakes during the night, it’s harder for me to get her back to sleep. I used to be able to nurse her back to sleep within minutes and recently it can take an hour or longer, it seems she’s wide awake in the middle of the night sometimes - I don’t understand why? Is this all just the result of teething?

Now that he’s becoming heavy I can’t rock him to sleep anymore, he’ll only sleep if I’m wearing or rocking him and as soon as I put him down he wakes up and starts crying, also my back hurts so much I think it’s becoming damaging, Even while rocked he’ll always fuss/cry while drifting off.

I’ve started recently to try nursing him to sleep instead of rocking him, at first it worked but now that he figured it out he started screaming every time I nurse him in the bedroom (so much fun!).

 

Basically anything I try becomes obsolete after it becomes a routine Because he figures out that it’s time to sleep and starts to scream immediately, I know he’s not in pain/scared because as soon as we star chatting/distracting him with anything he’ll be fine and start babbling.

&#x200B;

So now that I’m at the end of my wits I started just holding him on the bed at bed time, he figured it out and now every time I hold him while on the bed he starts screaming, I try to sing to him/ pat his hair/forehead but he just screams more and more until I cave in and rock him(usually after 10 mins)

&#x200B;

I feel like a horrible mother and I know I’m damaging his attachment but I have no idea what else to do other than that, especially considering he cries every night (even while rocked), I can’t shake this feeling that he’ll keep screaming like this until he’s like 3 years old because his cousin is exactly like this and still does the same as a toddler.

The boys weren’t having it.. if they played soccer it would be with my daughter right there in the sand. I could see the mothers getting more and more frustrated, so they started to shame their sons.. telling them they wouldn’t be athletes if they kept playing with toys, and that they wouldn’t be allowed to eat so much bread if they didn’t exercise. 

Still, the boys natural instinct prevailed and they continued playing in the sand with the trucks. One boy finally accepted his mother’s begging to play soccer, but when his mother tried to put away the toys in the meantime, he said “no, that’s for the baby”. And he brought all the toys and put them in front of my daughter.

32,AttachmentParenting,"Our sleep training went quite smoothly, so much so, we didn’t have to do much other than give him the opportunity to resettle himself and he did and it was a blessing.
Now we’re, I’m assuming, at a point where he’s going to transition to one nap and the wake ups are a steady 5 am daily… also fighting naps lately. He would cry until we got him and letting him CIO is no option here. I also don’t see a point in doing that since he’s up on his feet screaming, he’s not semi-asleep trying to go back to sleep.

33,AttachmentParenting,"My baby girl is 8 months-old and she is breastfed. 

I can’t seem to find a consistent answer to this question from my health visitor (I am based in the UK), or from other sources like books so curious to hear anecdotal experience on this. 

My little girl is currently on two meals a day, breakfast and lunch. We are doing a combination of traditional and BLW, we do mostly purees/softer foods (although with loads of lumps and textures by now), and some finger foods like steamed veggies, pasta, toast, although she will also feed herself after the inital first few mouthfuls the purees.

We tried introducing dinner last month but she is not there yet. She doesn’t want solids in the evening, and I would say she is a very average eater. Not the sort to outright reject all solid food, but definitely not the adventurous eater I see some babies being like, or eating loads and loads. I thought this was fine, but my health visitor thinks I need to move her to 3 meals a day, that she eats too little and that the reason for this is I still breastfeed on demand. She thinks I need to cut breastfeeding down to 3 milk feeds a day to increase the amount of solids she will eat. 

The thing is, I still nurse to sleep sometimes for naps (she doesn’t really accept nursing to sleep at night), and also, sometimes my baby will just climb on me and want to breastfeed. It doesn’t feel natural to tell her no, but I do get that by 9 months she needs to be on 3 solid meals a day.

34,AttachmentParenting,"So what do you do? 

I’m exhausted and my mental health is in the toilet. He’s coming up to 14 months now. I’m back at part-time work and my OH is full-time with some travel where I solo parent 1 week a month. 

We have a solid routine. Baby isn’t ill or teething. He goes down to sleep fine. Gentle sleep consultant is baffled too even after a home visit. 

Early hours of today I fell asleep on the upstairs landing for around 15 minutes (after being awake for almost 4 hours) and then proceeded to sleep walk around the house making a mess of the kitchen and the living room. My OH came down to find me sitting on the play mat stacking blocks with a teddy bear. He guided me back to bed and sat up with baby all night so I could sleep a bit. But its 6am now and we have to get up for work. 

My sleep walking/talking has never been this bad. We’ve never co-slept because of this but we’ve tried out of sheer desperation. Bought a new mattress, have the divan bed base stacked in the dining room. Made the room completely baby proof. Froze my arse off under a thin blanket and no pillow. 

I’m never comfortable though and stay awake all night even though I’m exhausted. After seven nights of 2 hours sleep you’d think I’d just pass out but I didn’t sleep and baby still woke up every 45-60 minutes whilst next to me. Same the following night and the next two. And last night. 

My OH is an extremely heavy sleeper so doesn’t feel safe in the bed alone with the baby.

We split nights 50/50 but we are both struggling as wherever you are in the house you can hear him cry even with headphones/ear plugs and white noise. So even on your “night/shift” off it’s still disrupted sleep and guilt that you aren’t helping out even though you can barely stand. We can’t bug out to a hotel every night and we can’t take turns to sleep in our car like we did in the summer as it’s too cold now. 

This isn’t a phase. It’s been a downward spiral from 6 months old and I can’t wait it out any more for it to “just get better”. I cry at 7pm every night because I know what is coming.

So what do you do? Everyone says to just carry on but this can’t be safe. It can’t be healthy for my baby. It’s not healthy for my relationship or either of us physically or mentally. 

So disheartened. Just can’t anymore.

39,AttachmentParenting,"I think we are a few weeks into the 18 month sleep regression where I know my son is tired but he is having trouble falling asleep for his naps and sometimes at night too. So I'm contemplating if I should wake him up a little earlier in the morning, something I have never done, just so he will nap earlier in the day and go to bed at a decent hour.

Right now he seems to be having a hard time falling asleep for his nap and sometimes doesn't sleep until quite late in the day (3pm) and so then that means bedtime is much later. Have you dealt with this and would you recommend trying waking him earlier in the morning so if he does need to stay awake longer (either because he just isn't tired or because he is tired but can't fall asleep as fast and takes longer to get to sleep) then he will nap earlier in the afternoon?

Also, there have been 2 days where he had no nap at all because we just couldn't get him to settle and rest no matter what we tried. The first time it happened he fell asleep around 7pm and slept horribly, waking up every hour for the first three hours and then several more times after that. The second time he crashed at 6:30pm and woke up an hour later and cried and cried and couldn't get back to sleep even though it was obvious he was trying and then finally crashed around 10pm but did sleep better at night and didn't wake as much.

So it's clear that he needs his nap still and this makes me think it is definitely a regression and not that he is ready to drop his nap. Plus when we do get him to sleep, he easily sleeps 2-3 hours. It's just the initial falling asleep that he is struggling with.

My question regarding days when he just can't seem to fall asleep for a nap, is it better to let him skip the nap entirely and risk a night of bad sleep (lots of wakings) or should we have him nap even if he naps from 3-5pm or 4-6pm and goes to bed late?

I know there are no guarantees and it's something we just have to go through, but I'd love to hear from people with real experience who have done this and see if there is anything that we can do to make it a little more manageable and help him get the rest he needs.

My baby was doing fine but has progressively been fighting to go to sleep. 
Everyday is different. One day he nursed or rocks to sleep immediately, no issues. We put him down and he’ll typically sleep 45m-1hr in his crib. Sometimes 1hr & 1/2 if we are lucky.

I know there are no cry methods but I did what I had read, familiar duvet from the bed, familiar songs and stories and cuddles but it didn’t seem to stop her tears. She wanted to be in my arms.

Without knowing that there was a word for it, I and my partner have done attachment parenting since my baby was born almost 9 months ago. It felt most natural to me to respond to my baby's needs. This also meant holding, rocking or nursing him to sleep which worked well for us for many months. I enjoyed these ways to help my baby sleep, and I would continue with them if they had not stopped working.

Since a few weeks, it is getting more and more difficult to get my baby to sleep. There is just no way I can console him anymore. Nothing seems to work anymore. he is either up and awake and playing or cries and cries. 

If I try to nurse him to sleep, he would latch off at some point, turn restlessly around, sit up and cry. If I want to rock him to sleep, he pushes me away with his little and yet so strong arms or bends backwards and cry, as if this position is not comfortable anymore. If I hold him, he tries to sit up an get away, sometimes playing, sometimes crying. 

Usually, I can get him to sleep for his bedtime, but when he wakes for the first time around 10pm, it can take me an hour or more to get him back to sleep. Getting him to sleep is frustrating me and my partner every single evening. My baby is now a little over 10kgs, so holding or rocking him, while he tries to push us away, is also physically exhausting.

I just don't know how else I can help him settle. Many people are starting to pressure us to do sleep training, arguing that our methods don't work. Yes, they don't work anymore, but I cannot leave my baby to cry on his own (no matter whether it is Ferber, CIO or whatever method). Even if I would agree to sleep train, I don't think my baby could take it. He cries so much already while we respond to his needs (crying while changing the diaper, putting on pyjamas, holding him), I don't think he could take it. If I only put him for a minute into his crib to go to the bathroom after having rocked him for an hour, he would scream like crazy! Hell breaks loose if I ever just lay him down, so I would not even know how to start sleep training. Which I don't anyway. 

Do you have any tips? What can I do that is not sleep training?

Little one is sick (teething? Another cold right after we got over one last week?) and practically all I have time for is to hold and comfort her.

So my in-laws were in town for a few days, they came down to see our almost 10-month old baby and to give him his Christmas gifts. They live a few states away so they don't get to see him often so I know they were excited and so am I. I am currently almost 14 weeks pregnant, so I was also looking forward to the help as I am a SAHM. 

I know that my in-laws mean well but we have completely different views on parenting. For example, they think that I hold my baby way too much. They don't agree with bed-sharing, and my MIL is surprised that I plan on nursing longer than a year. These are all fine, they are allowed to disagree but it feels like they are insinuating that I am hindering my babe's development by making him too dependent. A big issue that we had is that our house when they came down was a little messy, I guess to remedy this my MIL took it upon herself to just clean each room of my house while I held the baby. I kind of felt really uncomfortable with this and tried to kindly ask her to do other things with us. 

I know that she means well and all but it felt like a major invasion of privacy and also I now no longer know where my things are. She also told my husband that she is worried about mine and baby's well-being. The truth is that I have been struggling a bit, I have started therapy for this though and I would've rather she spent her time helping with baby and talking to me. I feel incredibly judged by my in-laws at this time, and I don't think they understand the dedication I spend taking care of my son. The truth is though, that I really do love devoting this much time to my son.

69,AttachmentParenting,"My 11 month old has been on the only firm mattress we own on the floor since she grew out of her crib at 6 months. An RV King mattress. 

It has been great as I nurse to sleep and will lay with her during naps and any wake ups during the night. However, we are working towards putting her in her own room as my husband and I are noisy sleepers and feel she is not getting the rest she deserves. 

Here's the catch. Her room is itty-bitty, so we have a few options. 


1. Keep the current bed she's on and have ZERO floor space in her room. But she is a MOVER in her sleep and can travel miles in a roll or two. She has rolled off only twice in the beginning.

2. Downsize to the next best thing - a queen or full - for at least SOME space. Similar to her current size and may not have an issue with movement?

3. Size down to a twin and she has enough room to play off of her bed. However snuggling will be a little harder, and I'm concerned about restricting her movement.

Now, the reasoning for new mattresses is because the rv mattress is getting uncomfortable for me, so it's more of a me problem that I'm willing to invest in. And as she grows I don't want her feeling that same discomfort. (Shes 99th percentile in every direction).

3. My baby gets very frustrated when she has to lay in her stroller for too long or is in the carrier for too long. I guess this is related to point 2.

He only goes one day a week, but every time I drop him off I feel so much guilt. He’s only done 3 days in total (he got sick for one week after the first day, and then he had one day he had a complete meltdown at drop off that I just couldn’t leave him there).
But, man, it’s so nice to have a break. I’m on extended maternity leave, and I really wanted to go back to work sooner but after all the trauma of having a premature baby I just can’t bring myself to rip off the bandaid and leave him in daycare.

He only spends about 5-6 hours there per day. But he won’t eat anything and he’s not crawling yet (he has a Global Developmental Delay) so he can’t be autonomous like the other toddlers.

Just seeking advice and validation for what I hope/am sure is a common issue. 

I work shifts and today am starting a week of night shifts where I am not at home for baby's bedtime. He's 5 months old right now. Tonight was the first night away where I haven't been able to be the one to put him to bed, and he cried inconsolably with my husband for almost two hours. Nothing helped - using the old T-shirt trick, feeding milk, driving. He just basically cried and cried and cried until he got too tired and fell asleep. 

I'm pretty heartbroken and also worried that this is going to create some sort of trauma for him. I know babies cry and separation anxiety is normal, but it absolutely breaks my heart to see him cry in a way that I've never seen him do before.

87,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all,

I’m about to have 2 under 2. We decided not to sleep train our now 15 month old. She sleeps in her room. We’ve had a few blissful nights where she slept through but she usually wakes up once or twice a night (teething? who knows) and we pat/rock her back to sleep. Baby #2 is coming in a few months. Current plan is dad will probably sleep in guest room and have monitor for baby #1 (who sleeps next door) while I nurse/take care of baby #2 (who will be in a basinet near our bed in the master bedroom). Hoping it’ll work and hoping our first will eventually sleep through consistently! But I wanted to ask if anyone else has been in a similar boat and how you managed. Better yet, if there are any parents who didn’t sleep train/cosleep with 3 under 3 I’d loveeee to hear from you! Thank you!

88,AttachmentParenting,"Hi, I’m not sure if has been asked before but I’m new to this sub. 

We have a 3 month old who currently spends most of her time with me (mum), while dad works. When dad takes baby it doesn’t take long (<30 minutes) before she cries and wants mum back, even if dad has a bottle ready.

What’s been people’s approach in this situation? Some people say that it’s best for primary carer to just leave the house for a while and let them work it out, and eventually baby will get used to the other parent. This seems like a sort of trial by fire, and I’m worried this will lead to some insecurities for baby.

We also all go to bed together at the same time (although me, das, sometimes gets up again after everyone sleeps to get some things done). 

Over time we have extended our bed with a side-bed so we have some more space and kids can move to their own space if they feel like it. 

I couldn’t even imagine anything different. Why is this not normal in society?

I often get asked if I can still sleep properly or whether we as parents have enough time for ourselves. And yes, we sleep well and we also have plenty of parents time.

We stopped going for walks in the park because he hates stroller and I can’t let my back suffer another 30 minute walk with him in the carrier (I front carry using Lillebaby)

We tried keeping her in her crib but she *loves* the comfortnof the breast and its pretty much been the only way to get her to sleep for long stretches of time (6+ hours)

The problem is that my partner basically never gets a decent night of sleep and it obviously affects her energy levels throughout the day as well as her mood. We know that for all our sakes we should start moving her to her own room pretty soon, but we're worried because:

1- We fear she's gotten too used to sleeping with us and won't accept her own bed. She's very attached to human contact and gets fussy at night if she goes even 15 minutes without breast or some kind of human presence.

2- There's a very curious cat in the house who we've caught sleeping in the baby's bed a few times, so we're worried what if he gets on her bed while the baby is sleeping during the night. A potential solution is locking the cat out of the room but the baby's room leads to the balcony where the cat's litter/food bowl is at.

My boss has been super gracious with me, allowing me to work flexible hours to be with LO more during the day. So typically, after LO goes to sleep and I spend an hour with my husband, I sit down to work late at night (usually until 1 am or 2 am). This works out well 85% of the time, but some nights, like tonight, LO wakes frequently and needs to be nursed to sleep. I LOVE nursing LO to sleep, but when I'm trying to get a big work project done, it's hard to be interrupted twice an hour for 15-20 minutes. It gets in the way of my workflow. We co-sleep, so my husband is up in the room with him, but my husband has difficulty soothing him to sleep. He cuddles him, sings to him, the whole 9-yards, but LO won't fall asleep until he gets the booba (as we refer to it). I feel bad because I get frustrated with my husband, who is, in turn, frustrated with me since he needs to work in the am (he gets up at 6 am). He doesn't get frustrated with me because I'm working, but because he thinks LO is too dependent on nursing to sleep, he's frustrated he can't soothe him.

Do you have any suggestions/tips? I'm letting my husband try his hand at putting him back to bed, but it's not working out, so I'm going to intervene.

EDIT TO ADD Thanks for the support, everyone. I'm adding here that I work three days a week during the day, and I have childcare on those three days. My nighttime hours make up my time on Thursday and Friday, which I take off and spend with my little one. So there's the flexibility, nighttime hours for two days during the work week with my baby. 

These suggestions are all very helpful. My husband is a teacher, and so next week, when he's off, he's going to work on comforting LO during those night wakes (after we rule out hunger) to learn his ways to soothe him to sleep while not having the pressure of being up at 6 am the next day. It turns out he did rock him to sleep last night, but LO woke up during the transfer to the bed. We are all learning over here. 

I appreciate this community!

We co-sleep and she nurses to sleep and when she wakes up in the morning. I have never spent a night away from her but there have been around three nights that I was out until late and her dad successfully put her to sleep. It was not easy for both of them though, every time this happened she was just the whole evening asking why mommy wasn't there and when mommy would be back, and she was clearly sad. Then at some point in the night, when I was already back home and in bed with her, she would wake up, hug me and happily say ""mommy is back, mommy is back!"" before falling asleep in my arms again. 

Now my conundrum: my work loves to arrange trips out of the state/country, which are a mix of important strategy meetings and fun activities. Ever since I have been back to work (I am lucky to live in a country with good parental leave so I was with my daughter until she was a bit over one year old), there have been two trips like this that I didn't join because she was still too small. We are not forced to join these trips and always have the option to join the meetings via Zoom. My company understands this is not part of our job description and that some people can't be away from home for one reason or another, but of course, they would prefer it if we join.   


Now there's a new trip planned for next month that should take three nights and it's a one-hour flight away from home. I immediately declined because to me it's unthinkable to spend this amount of nights away from my baby. But then, after discussing with my husband, we came to think that I could probably go for only one night, join all the meetings and give my presentation in person, then be back the next evening in time to put my daughter to bed. It just feels so awkward to be the only one or one of the only people joining online, especially if you have to present something, which is my case. And of course, the fact that I keep refusing to join these trips is probably not that great for my career either, even though I don't think my bosses care that much. 

This somehow felt like a good compromise to me but then, after talking to my boss, I found out that the only reasonable morning flight would leave around 6 in the morning. The next available flight lands at almost 1 pm so that would mean I would miss half a day of meetings already and my boss thinks it's not worth going in this case. This 6 am flight means I would have to leave my house in the middle of the night without saying bye to my daughter, and I won't be there when she wakes up looking for a hug or for her morning milk. I don't know why but somehow this extra morning just feels too much for me and I am so worried that she will be too sad!

Centre-based daycares here are an extremely hot commodity and you can be waitlisted for years (ON., Canada) but I managed to find a spot for him with a wonderful home provider. We never sleep trained, we co-sleep at home for nap and bedtime, and the final steps of both routines usually consist of some chatting or songs, and then just some quiet cuddles as LO's eyes close. I mentioned to the home provider that LO still might need a little bit of support at nap time when we had our meet-and-greet, and whereas she agreed she probably could help him for ""the first little while"", she kind of then proceeded to hint that he was going to have to learn to fall asleep ""more independently"" because she's juggling 5 different LOs.


My husband works long hours so I've always been the primary sleep person in our home, but I do remember reading that how a LO falls asleep for one parent can be completely different from the other but just as successful. Does anyone have any stories about this being achieved at daycare as well? I'm feeling a little hopeful that the transition for him will be easy since he can take that final ""step"" to sleep just by us laying together, but admittedly I'm feeling a little sad because I do still love our routine at night, and I guess I'm kind of wondering if we can still have both?","Daycare and ""Independent Sleep""",1671582727.0

My one year old wqnts to nurse all the time and doesn't drink water or formula. I tried different sippy cups, open cup, different bottles.

117,AttachmentParenting,"Hi everyone. I’m FTM and need some advice to reduce crying for my 3.5 months old before sleep. Here is what I’ve been doing and I’m unsure if I’m doing it right. 

At every day nap, she’d be crying a little like she’s fighting it, and then she’ll be quick asleep, like under 2mins crying. However the crying gets more intense into the evening, like she’d cry out of tiredness. The crying happens almost only before sleep despite I follow the timing and look at her cues. I held her to get drowsy/to sleep, then I’d place her down in crib. She’d sleep 30-45mins in crib then wake up and I’d pick her up, sooth her and place her down again. I sometimes contact nap with her cuz I’m too tired and maman needs sleep. Night time tho, once she slept she’d go from 9:30 til morning. 

Activities wise, we do like piano gym activities, and grab stuff, or tummy thing, but before the last feed, I’d read, play with me, a lot less stimulating. 

I’d really like to *reduce her crying*, if that’s possible? Though she isn’t crying for long I’m wondering what else I can do for her?

———

Annex:

There’s no set hour but her patterns of late is: 
1. 7:30 - wake for ~1.5hrs to feed and play then nap for 1hr
2. 11:00 - wake for ~1.5hrs to feed (with top up) and play then nap for 2hrs+ (her biggest nap of the day) 
3. 14:30 - wake for ~1.5hrs to feed and play then nap for 1.5hr 
4. 17:30 - wake for ~2hrs to feed (with top up) and play then nap for 1hr
5. 21:00 - wake for ~2hrs+ to feed and play then

118,AttachmentParenting,"Hi

My two year old (26 months) has been a fantastic sleeper in their own room since 10 months. 

Just over a week ago LO refused a nap and now refuses to sleep in the cot. 

LO will happily play and pretend to sleep in the cot but as soon as lights go out sobs saying sleep in mama bed. 

We’ve ridden it out for 12 days now and I’m ready to get my nights back and not go to bed at 7pm (and contact nap for the day nap on the play couch in LO’s room). 

Any tips? 

I’m vehemently against CIO obviously but not sure how much longer I can do this to wait out the (I think) separation anxiety. LO will let dad do bedtime but is happier when I do it. The freak out when I leave the room is much worse than when dad leaves the room.

120,AttachmentParenting,"I feel so clueless about this and really need help! My daughter was a breast refuser so she was bottle fed from 3 days old and she is very attached to the bottle as a sleep crutch. I fully intended to at least switch her to a cup at 12 months but she was extremely angry about it and just would not calm down so instead we started watering down her nighttime bottles so she wasn’t downing a massive quantity of milk (cows milk, I stopped pumping at 12 months) and planned to continue doing that until it was just water. Then we had a protracted period of serious illness where she lost weight so it didn’t seem a good time to cut calories. 

To slightly complicate things she has a swallowing issue and all her drinks are thickened - its kinda to the texture of slime so I feel like they might be more satiating than standard milk or water. 

She has a bottle before her nap at home, and before bed every night. For pushchair/car naps she doesn’t have milk and she doesn’t have it for her naps at nursery. Some nights she sleeps through, but if she does wake she usually angrily demands a bottle. Do I just persist on the watering down or are there better methods? 

I’m worried about her teeth, and also that I’m never going to be able to get rid of the bottles! She drinks from a cup no problem during the day and isn’t interested in milk then.

Also for those in the trenches exhausted with their efforts to try and help their offspring to sleep, but unwilling to sleep train. I often see people posting about either, so I figured I'd post this for those people to read.

Our toddler was nursed to sleep until he didn't want to anymore, sometime around 20 months or so. We then cuddled, rocked and sang him to sleep for all naps and night sleep. A few months back he started pointing to the crib, wanting to fall asleep there. He couldn't manage and got very upset and very hyperactive every time we tried. We tried all sorts of things, like lying down next to the bed, touching him calmingly in the crib (injurious!), moving back and forth between bed and lap, etc etc etc. I even asked for (and got!) advice on this sub on how to tackle it.

In the last few weeks he's suddenly worked it out. He started falling asleep in his own bed, with us ose by him. He was so proud. This week he's been sending us out so he can play and talk to himself a bit, then zonks out. 

It feels absolutely magical. I really miss the cuddles with him asleep in my arms. But man I am so, so proud of my not-so-little-anymore son. He worked it out all by himself, at his moment and on his own initiative. And he sleeps so incredibly well now, which really has not been the case in earlier times.

I'm so glad we went through all the rough patches and the hard work of helping him calm down all those times he couldn't sleep. All those hours of rocking and singing and pacing.  It all lead this this. A seamless, easy transition into doing it himself. Confidently. Because he knows he will get help if he needs it. And because he is ready.

124,AttachmentParenting,"So, LO is 10.5 months old. He is typically a pretty great sleeper. We have a consistent nighttime routine that ends with me nursing him to sleep in our bed around 7:30/8pm. I then nija out of bed and have time to do all things that come with parenting + being human + being a FT employee. I typically tuck in with little one officially between 12am-2am, after all the things are done (including working a few hours). Well, lately, he's been taking a long time to fall asleep initially. Typically, I nurse him to sleep and it takes anywhere from 10 minutes-20 minutes to fall asleep but, over the last two weeks, it's been taking 1 hour-1.5 hours for him to fall asleep. I've typically cycle through all the tricks in the book, I sing to him, I gently rub his cheek, I hold him close and place a hand on his chest, I put on his calming music playlist, I put on white noise, we have silence, sometimes we sit up and I nurse him to sleep that way and then gently place him down, sometimes I give him 5-minutes alone and then go back in and try again (mostly because I need to calm down or pee or something). But when it takes a long time for him to fall asleep, I start to really run through my to-do list and get anxious and I know that rubs off on him. So then I'm practicing deep breathing and acceptance for feelings of guilt for not being present with him. Any tips? Any ideas on why this may be happening?

I will add that during this elongated nursing to sleep time, he is clearly sleepy, eye rubbing, nodding now and again, fidgeting and then calming down, eyes half closed but not all the way closed. I know he's super sleepy but I can't figure out why he's not actually sleeping.

As a side note, for parents that nurse to sleep, when you are in the act of nursing and letting baby drift off to la-la land, how present are you? I have this big battle for presence. It's so much quiet time with him every day and I ADORE the quiet, snuggly time. I let myself soak it ALL in. But, it's also A LOT of quiet, snuggly time and sometimes my mind drifts or I find myself on my phone. I feel especially guilty when I use my phone. I try to wait until he's actually really, really sleep (like eyes ARE closed) but with this long-time-to-sleep habit, I give into my phone during pockets of silence and I feel awful about it. Is this a weird pressure that I put on myself to be present? What do other folks do?

Okay, one more follow-up thing, so I LOVE nursing to sleep but I'm wondering when it typically pitters off. When do babies typically fall alseep without needing to nurse? I'm happy to keep it going for as long as needed but I'm looking for some feedback on when things may start to shift (mostly so I can mentally prepare). For those that nurse to sleep, what do other caregivers do when you can't be there? I'm going to start working in the office 1-2 days per week and am not sure how my Mom will get LO to sleep.

I appreciate this community a lot. I learn a lot by reading through these posts.

Update: 

A typical day: wake up around 7:30 am/8 am, 3-hour wake window, nap from 11 am-12:00 pm/12:30 pm, 3-hour wake window, nap around 3 pm-4 pm/4:30 pm, sleep around 7:30 pm/8 pm. 

However, some days his wake time varies and that throws us off. Like yesterday we all slept in until 9:30 am, which was WONDERFUL but then it threw his naps off and I ended up fitting in a second nap probably too close to bedtime because that second wake window was longer than normal. Sometimes his nap length varies too which throws me off. Like sometimes his first nap is 40 minutes but sometimes it's 2.5 hours. Is this kind of variance normal?

I'm thinking that maybe on days when he sleeps in late OR has a long first nap, I should try adjusting the second nap by shorting it or nixing it all together.",Babes taking A LONG time to fall asleep...and being present with LO.,1671419520.0
125,AttachmentParenting,"My LO will turn 1 this month. I can’t believe it. She hasn’t had tons of time with peers (covid times and I’m a SAHM), so I try to let her interact with kids when we find them at the park or at church.
I’m trying really hard not to be a helicopter parent, but I’ve encountered older kids kind of picking on her and am not sure how to handle it properly. I’ve read about being a sportscaster rather than a referee (“it looks like 2 kids want the blue ball. I wonder what we they’ll do about it?”)


Ex 1: playing in the sand at the park. A boy, maybe 5, not speaking, keeps coming back to my LO. Takes a stick she’s playing with, leaves. Runs away if I try to talk to him. Then she’s crawling away, and he keeps standing in front of her to prevent her. Why?


Ex 2: bigger toddler girl, maybe 2.5-3, at church comes over to LO, smiling, patting her head. LO has a toy car, girl wants car but initially shows her where the buttons are to push. Does this for a minute then takes car. LO protests a bit. Girl takes her hand and shakes it, initially LO likes it, girl starts to get rough. I take LO’s hand and tell girl we have to use gentle hands with the baby.  She leaves. Comes back. Teases baby with car. Puts it under her dress. Starts aggressively shaking LO’s hand again. I repeat gentle hands. Eventually girl gives LO the car. 

What am I supposed to do in situations like this? I want to let the kids work things within reason, and I really am trying not to helicopter, but it’s usually much bigger kids who take whatever toy she seems interested in, and their parents are always absent.

My issue is literally this last week only she has started desperately fighting sleep. 

Nap routine is bottle,  rock and 1-2 songs and/or humming to sleep then transfer to her toddler bed.

At naps, she will act really sleepy and ready for a nap, we will have a bottle and her eyes will be rolling into her head she is so sleepy, then I get to the little song I sing to her at nap time or right before the song and from her dozing she either bolts upright or starts to kick her feet really quickly as if jolting herself awake. Any time she starts to doze she will repeat that behavior. She also begins to request books, not part of our nap routine, singing anything but our 3 bedtime songs, or playing with the nearby curtain.  She even gets up and walks away a while, usually returning with a toy or another book or just ready to snuggle down...but then as soon as she begins to doze the process repeats. On top of this, naps have gotten shorter and shorter all week up to today where she managed 2 barely half hour naps. She was previously a 1, occasionally 2, napper for 1.5-2 hours and occasionally 3.

Bedtime routine is say goodmigjt to daddy, bottle, brush teeth, into our bed for snugs and 1-2 songs, she would previously fall asleep by the time we nearly finished first song but some days need a second. 6:30-7pm is usually bedtime. 
Now, she acts ready for bed and gets excited to initiate the routine but as soon as we go back to bed for snugs, CHAOS. She might stay still through part or all of 1 song then begins thrashing,  flailing and often hitting or scratching me in her fails but I don't think purposely, kicking, repeatedly getting up and throwing herself on to the bed. If I try to touch her, hold her, support her, help her sit down, she goes stiff and arches backward falling into the bed sometimes. I do my best to not let her fall off. She also moans/whines/not cries but like, sort of wailing moans that sound really frustrated? Hard to describe.  Not much stops her from this. I've ended up getting up with her and letting her putter a while or slinging her around in a backpack toddler carrier as I finish chores. She has fallen asleep between 9:30pm-9:55 each night, on me, on the couch beside the Christmas tree only after hitting absolute exhaustion. Tonight was a nightmare,  I did everything early in anticipation of bedtime saga so had no backpack worthy chores so I just sat with her on our couch spot. She begged for books and flopped around any time she would doze off, cried, walked away and would trip or bump into the dog in her tiredness and have a big cry. Just wild.

She doesn't get screen time and isn't interested in much besides real animal videos or docs anyway, in bursts of a few minutes.

140,AttachmentParenting,"Lately I’m having trouble keeping regulated with my seven month olds sleep. He’s always been a terrible sleeper, and we’re still waking up every two hours minimum (usually closer to every hour) at night. The real issue is getting him down for sleep. Often, it’s a hour long struggle where he’s screaming, hitting and hair pulling and I’m having to restrain him from popping right back up. Rinse and repeat for three naps plus bedtime. 

We’ve already tried everything you can think of to make sleeping time better, and I think at this time the best we can do is weather it. How do you weather hours of this without completely checking out?

141,AttachmentParenting,"Hi everyone,

My wife and I have booked a week long international trip next year for which we are really excited about going without kids (who will be 3 and 1 year old when we go).

The only issue with who will watch the kids:

* My in-laws are tenatively picked to watch them the whole time that we are gone because they are more likely to follow our parenting style which is more attachment based. They would be taking them back to their house which is not that far away from our house. They watch them frequently and our older kid has spent nights at their house in the past.
* My mother doesn't really see our kids that often mostly through personal choice because she is always running around. She has demonstrated in the past that she doesn't follow our parenting style (favouring a more CIO approach - when she babysat our nieces/nephews, they were already sleep trained). If my mother did watch them, she would be watching them in our house because she lives two hours away and doesn't have any car seats in her car.

While it sounds the choice is obvious, my mother was hurt when we told her the tenative arrangement because she knows how often that my in-laws see our kids. We feel bad that my in-laws would keep the kids for the whole time but we aren't sure if my mother will get up in the night or ignore them too much during the day? When she has visited in the past, she has done these things: Let our 5 month old fuss in the swing/activity centre or in the bedroom if he isn't crying (""he's fine, he's not crying""/""I would just leave him""). We personally wouldn't let our younger one scream/fuss by himself and what she does/says makes us uncomfortable.

Update:
Well I made it through. I have never seen my sweet girl throw herself around scream and cry like that before. She also had bouts where she wouldn’t want me to touch/hold her which just made it harder but I kept a level head, a calm voice, and tried to go off of her cues.

Typically he eats for three to five minutes then falls back asleep. The funny thing though, he has no interest during the day. He will push me away and claw at me if I try to feed him. Even before nap time or when it’s time to eat I have to coerce him into eating. I understand that he’s probably getting all his calories at night but every daytime feed is a scream fest. 

Did anyone else go through this? I have no interest in weaning him off nighttime feeds but cutting them down to 2-3 would be amazing and then I’m more than happy to feed him more during the day! We have started solids and that hasn’t affected his schedule.

What does it mean? I guess I broke our normal pattern of me coming in while he's crying and so he wanted us to relive the normal pattern?

We weaned 6 months ago. 

I’ve tried…
Shortening his nap
Letting him nap as long as he wants
Skipping the nap
Earlier bedtime
Later bedtime

The same result. He fights bedtime AND he’s crying throughout the night despite me BEING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM! I’m at a loss. He does the same with his dad. 

HOWEVER, if he is at my moms or at daycare, he puts himself to sleep no problem and sleeps like a rock. 

So part of me thinks it’s behavioral. We have good nights sometimes, but mostly not.

He’s slept the the night before, while still nursing. And that’s when I weaned. 

I can’t believe this is sickness or teething, not for 3+ months.

The schedule he is happiest at is this:

7:30am wake
1-3pm nap
8:30 bedtime, 9-9:30 falls asleep

He wakes around midnight and then a few more times before wake.

I can get him to nap easy if I comfort nurse him. For my husband he will cry until he passes out. A few times we tried the bottle and he’ll suck on it to pacify but, he won’t take a pacifier.

I love my son so much. So deeply it hurts. I longed to have him here in my arms, exactly as he is right now. I want to tend to his every need. I want to console him and make him feel safe. It shatters my heart to hear him cry. He is my whole world and I hope to be his. 

All that said, I don’t think I’m cut out to be a mother. It’s so so hard and I’m starting to not be able to handle it. I thought I was a patient person, but it is running thin. I thought the overwhelming love I have for my child would make this more bearable but it has not. I am just losing it. 

My son is 3 months old and I know we are still so freshly in this but that’s what worries me. He requires so much assistance getting to sleep. Rocking, patting, walking, bouncing. My back and arms can’t handle it anymore. It takes upwards of an hour sometimes to get him to sleep. I am cautious of “wake windows” but mostly follow sleepy cues. I feel like I’m doing okay at catching him when he is tired but he just FIGHTS sleep like it’s his job. I get so frustrated-  I can’t help it. I can’t rock him forever; it’s so hard when I see his eyes are so heavy, closing slowly and I’m almost there.. when all of a sudden he starts squirming and fussing again. I feel like I’ve tried it all.. all the positions, nursing to sleep, a reset or a break. When all is said and done, it’s basically time to eat again and he hasn’t slept a wink. If he does fall asleep, it’s a contact nap or nothing. The amount of times I’ve tried to put him down only to have him wake is countless. I’ve tried all the tricks to transfer successfully. I don’t even try anymore because he wakes and all the work is wasted. He is attached to me almost all day. Nursing, sleeping.. and then there’s maybe 15 min of play where I can set him down long enough to wash my face and use the bathroom. He hates walks, in the stroller and the carrier, hates car rides and I’m stuck inside my house all day.

I know he doesn’t understand it hurts but he made my nose bleed last night and I had tiny bleeding scratches on my neck and chest. 

I put him down in his cot so I could stop the bleeding. He screamed hysterically for almost 10 minutes. In the end he was flinging himself around the cot, hitting his head and kicking the bars. 

I went back in and he just screamed in my arms. I changed his nappy (wasn’t really wet), checked his temperature, checked him over whilst I changed him, offered water (he spat it out and chucked the cup away) and I gave him Calpol in case a tooth or something was bothering him. 

My OH takes a turn in case a change of person helps. Even worse screaming. I swap back because my OH is sick at the moment. 

Held him etc. but again more hitting and screaming. If I put him down he’d scream again. I had to take a little break at hour 2 because my rocking was getting a little to strong and he was crying anyway. So I had a little 5 minute cry myself.

I’m going back to work next week. I can’t be up for 3-4 hours every night and this has been going on for close to a week and we had sleep issues before this.

My 6-year-old son has ADHD & autism. I need help getting him to stop purposely antagonizing his 3-year-old sister with his actions. Just this morning (It's only 8 am where I am) he got in her face and was laughing/screaming, obvi to get a reaction. Before I could intervene, she hits him on the head with a giant decorative candy cane. This type of interaction happens extremely frequently, and I am exhausted.    


Things we have tried -  

\- Exhausting him. He is enrolled in Jiu Jitsu 3 times a week, we go to the playground after school 3 days a week, we walk to school and we walk home (.5 mile walk to school)    
\- Talking to him. I try to explain that when he starts to feel ""wiggly"" (I also have ADHD so I relate a lot to what he's feeling and this is the best way we've found to explain the feeling) that he should try to find better ways of getting that energy out like running, riding his bike, playing tag, etc. But he can't harass his sister and he needs to ask her ""are you having fun?"" more frequently. It helps, but only if we constantly remind him to check in with her. We also remind him ""hands to yourself"", ""give people their space"", and ""if you can touch her then you are too close"".    
\- Stepping away. If I can tell that he's just having too much energy, then we (him & I) will go into his room to breathe together until he's a bit more calm. We also try stepping away to walk around, or go ride his bike, but sometimes we just have to go in his room bc he will try to slip past me to get back to harassing his sister.    


We are also trying to get him some type of occupational therapy but considering how long it's taken us to even get a diagnosis, idk when that will happen. The system is frustrating and disappointing. I try to intervene as much as possible but mentally I cannot be 24/7 on him like flies on a pile of shit to try and make sure that he's not agitating everyone around him.",Need help with impulse control for ADHD 6 year old,1670689908.0

6 month old baby, has never had great sleep (7-10 wakes/1-3 hour stretches forever, will only contact nap/cosleep) but used to go down pretty easily until around 4 months. Now it’s a mix bag— he virtually always goes to sleep on the nursing pillow in my lap; some sleeps he readily  accepts nursing to sleep or being rocked with a pacifier in my lap/very rarely  standing. But at least half the time he absolutely loses it at the first attempt to sooth him in any way. 

He will be showing all his sleepy cues, even falling asleep during story time etc, but as soon as you even start to lie him down he just starts wailing. I usually stop, read another story, or do a calm activity for 10 min then try again, and SOMETIMES this works, but other times he’s just clearly tired and miserable and then he’s even more inconsolable when I’m trying to help him sleep after. So sometimes I just push through the crying and keep rocking/replacing pacifier, etc and he EVENTUALLY falls asleep, but it is SO stressful for me and I’m genuinely concerned that it is having a negative impact on him. I think he is developing negative associations with the pillow/position/rocking  because of how immediately he becomes distraught when you even begin to start putting him to bed 🤦‍♀️

If you follow baby cues for sleep, what do you do when they are giving conflicting signals, i.e. tired but does not want to be put to sleep? We’ve tried just continuing to take breaks until he falls asleep easily but that often ends with him being over-tired which causes his sleep to be extremely restless/constant wake-ups.

164,AttachmentParenting,"Some may be familiar with my story, but I am here for more advice. It's regarding Grandad and his lack of respect for consent with my now 20 month old.

We have been going to visit Grandad more now that the weather is improving. We go to his property and hang out outside (he lives on a bus off grid). Grandad rarely comes to ours to visit (which is fine by me but that's because I don't like him, but its disappointing both for my partner (his father) and for my LO). 

The issue is that my LO doesn't seem to like Grandad, more and more. Grandad will poke him and touch him, even when my LO is pulling away and saying no. Partner and I have spoken to him again and again, saying that LO isn't comfortable with that and if Grandad wants physical contact then he has to let LO initiate it. 

Whenever Grandad comes to ours (only occasionally) and we are INSIDE the house, LO is much more inclined to get close to Grandad and even climb on his knee, cuddle etc. 

We invited Grandad over last friday, and told him it was specifically so he could do just that, sit inside and let LO come to him. This happened after LO fell over and screamed no to Grandad not to touch him and ""help him up"", to which Grandad ignored and picked him up, only for LO to kick and buck in his arms. I was pissed. My partner chastised LO, saying ""Grandad was only trying to help"". I got out of my comfort zone and said ""He said no!"" 

So, I thought if LO spends more time with Grandad that he would grow more comfortable and affectionate towards him.  Part of me is uncertain about this concept. Am I putting my son in the middle? Am I manipulating him? I do just want him to feel comfortable around his Grandad, that's a big part of it. But I can completely understand why he doesn't like him when he keeps touching him when LO clearly says no.

Anyway, Grandad didn't show up on friday. Said he had some things to do instead. I cannot believe it. I was facilitating for him to get what he wants but he didn't make the effort. 

The point of this post is, what do you think? Is this the right approach? Considering that my partner is absolutely shit at standing up for our son, especially against his own father, I feel like this situation is going to escalate if I don't intervene and get LO more accustomed to Grandad. I can see when LO reaches a certain age that I am going to get pressured to ""let"" Grandad babysit (don't worry, I am not allowing it until Grandad consistently changes his behaviour!) 

What would you do/say? I have clearly said ""He said no!"" and Grandad is still stuck in his ways more often than not. I absolutely haaaaate this situation 😓😭",Consent issues,1670634130.0

167,AttachmentParenting,"I have a two week old and a 22 month old. 22 month old has slept in our bed since 2 months old. He has never been a good sleeper. We have struggled with waking up early from birth think 4:30 to 5am. He wants to go to bed at 7pm every night begging us to rock him to sleep. Recently he had gotten better still waking but easily resettled. Now cue baby sister.

He is waking up crying and crying hard. We soothe him and tell him "" mommy and daddy are tired and he needs to sleep.

168,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all, I've found this sub and I'm so happy! I have taken a rather intuitive approach to caring for my 11 months old so far. I didn't start with any particular philosophy in mind, I have just adapted to what feels right and what works for her and us. I breastfeed, nurse to sleep for both naps and bedtime, cosleep, baby wear on and off every day. I am fortunate to be able to stay at homr with her while husband goes to work. She is more bonded to me and is able to be comforted best by me, though we are working on her being equally as able to be comforted by dad, we just don't push or force it. She is always with me. I have had my mom watch her while I leave the house, a couple times, for about 45 minutes. Husband has also done this once. All of this just feels very natural and right to us and we don't experience that it is a burden or anything. We don't feel that she is overly attached to me in an unhealthy way, or that this signifies any problem that needs to be fixed. We just simply flow with her, and right now we just know that she primarily needs me, as I have the boob, etc etc. 

Now that the holidays are upon us, I have been invited to a couple events (ladies nights) and I am finding myself to all of a sudden be aware that I guess this is not ""normal?"" I have asked the people hosting gatherings if I can bring my daughter, because right now she is essentially just with me all the time, and that's our life right now. And it's been astonishing to me that I have been met with concern over this? And things like ""everyone else is getting childcare, could you for one evening?"" And ""oh youre nursing to sleep, sorry that must be hard that you have to be with her all the time!"" And ""oh hun I know its hard to leave them with someone else, it was hard for me too the first time I did it but they get over it."" 

None of the way I'm parenting her feels wrong or burdensome at all, or in need of fixing. I'm just rather surprised at how unwelcome I feel to simply parent this way, and be understood. To me this is in no way feels like we're ""late"" to any milestones. I just feel like I'm parenting my child in what feels to be a biologically appropriate way? 

Anyway, I think this is my first experience in feeling judged for the way I'm parenting. I know this is my call to do inner work over this, carry onward with what feels right in my heart and what is best for our family. But right now Im acknowledging and voicing my hurt, and that I feel a little bit alone, other than my husband who is also completely supportive of how we do things.

He barely smiles at other people, even close family. 

He doesn't laugh at toys, funny faces, silly noises. He will sometimes let out a little laugh with tickles, but it takes a lot of work and you'll only get the one little laugh if you're lucky. I'm so jelous when I see babies giggling when being played with and having giggling fits because I've never had that. 

He doesn't babble, he does a lot of grunting noises which just sounds like he is frustrated and mad. Sometimes he even goes bright red when doing this like a temper tantrum. Other than that the only other noise he does is blowing raspberries and an occasional squeal. No vowel sounds, coos, ma mas or da das.

174,AttachmentParenting,"So I practice attachment parenting and gentle parenting for my 13 month old son. 

Everyone around us (including my husband) disagree with the way I parent. It hasn't come up much as my son is just now entering his toddler years and is just starting to test boundaries, but we are out of town staying with my sister in law and her family and it's so frustrating because our parenting styles are so different. While I disagree with the way she patents her kids, I also realize that it's not my business and I wouldn't dream of saying anything about it. However my husband is seeing the way she parents and is trying to implement the same methods with our toddler. 

For example my son likes to grab my husband's glasses off of his face. I usually just tell him ""daddy's glasses need to stay on his face"" and either have my husband put him down or I'll give him something else to play with. But now, he thinks we should start smacking his hands when he trys to grab the glasses because that's what his sister would do. 

Earlier I put my son in the crib for a nap and a few minutes later he starts fussing and crying. I gave it a minute, then once I realized he wasn't calming down I went in there to soothe him. As I walked away I heard them make comments about how I should've just left him to cry and my husband agreed.

If it was my choice we would continue to contact nap but unfortunately I have to work from home, so I started working on getting him to nap in his crib. 
It took about a week & 1/2 but today he had his best day yet napping away from me. His longest nap was an hour and 40 minutes after nursing/rocking him to sleep and transferring him. 
I miss his snuggles so much already… but also like not feeling so touched out. 
I love having a little bit more freedom… but also miss his doe eyes and bashful smile when he would wake up after his nap on me… oh that is just the most heart melting feeling.
Posting this here because the other moms in my life can’t understand. They refused to contact nap, don’t enjoy it, or believe you shouldn’t hold babies for naps. I just simply got tired of having a power struggle trying to get my baby to nap in his own space during those first months. When your sleep deprived, it truly is a struggle to constantly be up and down with a baby all day. So I embraced the contact naps and it became something I truly cherished.

176,AttachmentParenting,"Welcome! Today I have an interesting theme I want to bring into awareness. I am writing about the subconscious mind and I realized the importance of evolving into the different phases of live from dependence, to independence, into interdependence. Why is this important ?Would it be nice to know exactly where I stand today? What steps can I take to evolve into the next phase of life? Will my entire life transform, the outcome of life, experiences, situations, relationships, circumstances, work, people and so on? 
The dependence phase starts at birth and goes through the age of 18 legally, when the individual must be able to take decisions for himself. This phase can build up an individual to set him or she off into the independence phase of his life. Through guidance, support, teaching skills, teaching structure, explaining, encouraging the individual to know he’s or she’s boundaries, preferences, knowing their strengths and weaknesses, feelings, financial intelligence, emotional intelligence, love etc.
When all of this it is given, the individual has the base to develop into the next phase of his life smoothly and can apply what he or she has learned at home up till this time. It will be able to take strong, right decision for himself, follow his gut, feel his way through life, use his mind to discern, be happy by himself, acknowledge his needs, meet his needs, say no, etc. 
When all the above aren’t given at that time, one can evolve by learning it as an adult by himself or seeking help. When an individual remains in the stage of dependence and is an adult, he or she will create situations of power struggle, try to prove themselves, fighting to be seen, having a victim mentality, seeking validation from others, having expectations from others, not feeling good by himself, feeling alone by himself, feeling lonely in crowds, seeking for action constantly, wanting things from the outside, consuming, developing strategies to avoid certain things, not taking responsibility for his behavior and choices life outcomes, blaming game etc. What can also contribute to this phase are when the parents aren’t ready to let go of the child and let him go into his independence, there are parents which are not letting their kids grow up and they are still acting like they are babies, depending on them, which they are not anymore. The result creates individuals which believe that they are still entitled to the same structure as they have had at home, in their known environment, a dependent one, are having a hard time doing simple things by themselves, finding it hard to do new things, overwhelmed with finding solutions etc.
To complete this dependence phase is to learn how to be happy by himself, enjoy time alone, by himself, spend time quiet, love himself, set boundaries, give himself value, etc or herself.
The independent phase starts when an individual has already all these qualities above and goes on and explore the world, builds new relationship, apply what he has learn at home, find himself, is happy by himself, has healthy boundaries, is experiencing around, he gets to know what he likes, what he doesn’t like, what he wants for his life, what he doesn’t want for his life.
This phase can be entered at any age as long as you learn to love yourself, to be happy by yourself, to have boundaries, to respect yourself, to take care of yourself, on your own 2 feet, to know what you want and what you don’t want to be secure in your skin, your body, it’s basically all about self knowledge and self control, self awareness. 
The interdependence phase is the final phase of in someone’s life. In the interdependence phase he or she wants to share an eye to eye loving, equal, accepting nonjudgmental, compassionate relationship. The reliance of one another is wanted, seeing life as one, in the same time as individuals, this is a choice and both believe in these values. In this phase both are evolved into self-sufficient, self established, self love, self empowered, self compassionate individuals, commitment is key to partnership, leadership is shared, equality, understanding, stability, these are all attributes and values which both partners are bringing to the table. So based on the upbringing individuals will show through behavior where they stand in life and what is necessary to evolve. What a fun game to play! With little guidance everything is possible.All you need is one choice. Would you do it? Do you want to evolve?

My baby is 6 months old and everything is mostly great. I didn't plan to cosleep or breastfeed for longer than 6 months, I don't know why. What do you really know about having a baby before you have one? We've been enjoying both things very much so far. So what happened is that the day my baby turned 6 months my stupid brain started telling me that it's a failure that he doesn't sleep in his own bed or still fully nurses most days even if he ate something.

I'm aware that everything he does is within a normal range, but I the last few days I got so much more irritated with him. Today someone asked me (not even in a weird tone) if I'm still breastfeeding and I felt weirdly ashamed to say so. My family and husband are all wonderful. I am the only one putting this weird pressure on myself.

As a toddler, his unhappiness has transformed into neediness. He doesn’t let me clean, he doesn’t let me cook. Always in my skirts, crying. He’s caught up in my legs and then gets more upset when I accidentally knock him over when I walk. 

I carry him around the longest I can but he sees something and wants to be set down. If I’m brushing my hair, he wants the brush. If I’m doing my make up, he wants my mascara. Once his mind is set, he isn’t open to ANY alternatives and will just yell at me from the ground. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. My entire day is consumed by constant screaming and crying. The only time he’s happy is when he’s nursing- if it was up to him, I would be a potato on the couch just so he can nurse all day. I take him out to as many activities as I can because he’s unbearable in the house. However, I can’t do chores when we’re out and our house is constantly in disarray which makes my mental state even worse.

198,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all! I have a precious 7.5mo. She's been a high needs sleeper since the 4 month progression, which hit around 3mo for her. It was ROUGH all around for a couple weeks. Since then, we've fallen into the habit of feeding and rocking to sleep for naps and bedtime. First nap of the day is usually only 30-40 minutes but second nap is often 1-2 hours. 

The real problem is at night. She goes to bed in her crib fine, usually around 6:30-7:30. But then she wakes up within 3 hours, hungry. She'll take upwards of 5 additional oz of breastmilk during that first wakeup. (I really can't get her to eat any more during the day. She's a very good eater, I think.) 

After that, she wakes up probably every 1-2.5 hrs consistently. We usually co-sleep after midnight, and have been for several months now. When she's in bed with me, she just wants the boob and I usually give in because it's easy and the quickest way to get her to fall asleep (like many of you can relate to). But I'm afraid that's perpetuating her frequent wake-ups. 

My husband sometimes takes her for a full night and sleeps in her room, where we have another bed. She still wakes frequently but CAN go from 10p-5a without eating just fine with him.

My 9 month old has been sleeping boob in mouth for every nap and co sleeping at night since 4 months.

I’d really love her to at least day nap alone so I’ve been trying to get her used to her crib and putting her down for 10 mins before sleep to chill but she just screams straight away, no fussing just meltdown, for this mornings nap I thought I’d try rocking her instead but again ,… meltdown to the point of gagging. 

If I get her to sleep and wait 20 mins I try to transfer her to crib and she wakes up. 

I’m not sure if she’s in another regression period or because she’s a bit under the weather? She also has a b12 deficiency which we are still waiting for a hospital appointment for later this month.

I don’t mind co sleeping and contact napping occasionally but at the minute I goto bed when she does and I’m starting to feel bad for my husband. It would be great if she could start the night alone at least. 

On top of all this I really feel like it’ll be beneficial for her to self soothe and learn to sleep instead of waking and searching for boob throughout the night, I’m struggling with guilt thinking I’m making this difficult for her. 

So I was thinking maybe it’s time to look at gentle sleep training, it’s something I really didn’t want to do to be honest.

204,AttachmentParenting,"For context, she’s 20 months with great receptive language but a spoken language delay (she mostly relies on sign language).  So with the delay, I get how you could feel like you could talk about her in front of her. 

We just got done with a long week of hosting my daughter’s extended family and I want to be ready before the next long visit with everyone coming up in about a month. 

My daughter’s aunt and uncle would pester her for physical affection and when one of them would ask for a hug and she would instead go to hug her grandpa, they would call her things like “disgusting” and “savage”.  This happened too many times to count, and I feel bad I didn’t call it out sooner :( Of course there is also the other layer here of bodily autonomy- she doesn’t owe anyone a hug. 
Also her other uncle was asked to change the diaper trash, and besides being really dramatic and coughing a bunch (which I don’t think she picked up on) said stuff to her  like “this is your fault” and “biohazard”. The family in general likes roasting each other (including my daughter) for biological functions, especially farts/poops which doesn’t sit well with me either. 
My husband just brushed it off as uncles being uncles. Sometimes he too will call her a “troublemaker” if say she gets in a cabinet he forgot to re-lock while he is trying to stare at his phone. 

The aunt and uncle’s language/actions bother me the most.  I think I may try to correct them by maybe explaining to my daughter while they are present too that it’s her choice who she hugs and some people don’t handle their emotions (jealousy) well and say mean things, but she’s not disgusting. Hope they take the hint. 
My husband’s words bother me the second most and I know I’ve read how it’s bad to give your kids labels that they may think are who they are, but I just don’t have the brain power right now to get my argument together. With him, my plan would be to explain things directly to him after bedtime. In the moment, I will say things like “you’re not a troublemaker, you’re just expressing your curiosity and dada is upset he forgot to lock the cabinet”

I'm kind of just over it now.

She has really taken a liking to Finnley as he is a very gentle, calm, and loving animal. Now, just about anytime he's around, she will try to grab his face and pull it towards her. She'll chase him around the house when he's obviously trying to get away from her, and she has tried to hit him with toys multiple times. I stop her when I notice this behavior happening and, if I'm lucky, before it even begins. As soon as she approaches him, I remind her to only use one hand and to pet gently. I've shown her again and again how to pet him. I've tried explaining to her that he feels pain like us, and what the different sounds he makes mean. I've told her again and again, ""I will not let you hurt him. I'm going to move him to somewhere more safe/move you away from him now"" but she goes right back to being aggressive towards him the next time she sees him.

She is a very aloof baby anyway and nursing was the only time I would get to hold her close and feel that bond with her. She hates cuddling, refuses to cosleep, is not very interactive with us etc.

I’ve been severely depressed and don’t even want to see or hold her now. Yesterday I tried bathing with her and calmly offering to nurse for like the 50th time. She screamed, pushed away and acted like I was torturing her. That’s how she responded every time. I had done great the first three days but that time I spiraled and lost it. I forcefully put her down in her crib, held her arms down while I tried to suck out her snot with the nose frida. She bawled and lashed around so I threw the nose frida at the wall and left her to cry. She couldn’t even breathe through her snot still. But I knew I had to stay away so I wouldn’t risk hurting her. I ran to the bedroom and cried on the bed. My husband eventually came up from working and grabbed the baby.

Since then I’ve been very checked out and want to run away. Every time my husband tries to talk to me I spiral worse and get so angry at him even though he is just trying to help. I made him cry earlier and it proves to me I’m toxic and a bad wife/mom. I haven’t even looked at my baby today, my husband has cared for her while he works. He went out and bought formula and it felt like a dagger in my heart. I don’t know how to snap out of this. I know I can’t try to bf again, so I’m trying to accept our nursing journey is over.

We only see Gd sometimes once every couple of months, sometimes a couple of times a week. Gd will go out of his way to take LO out of my arms even when LO is crying no (that's on me to hold that boundary). If LO is near Gd then Gd will try to touch him, like poke his arm or leg, and LO will pull away again and again, yet Gd will continue. A couple of times this has made LO cry. One day Gd sat on the garden wall, right at the spot where LO needed to hold the wall to get down a step. We said to Gd ""That is where he holds to get down."" Gd said ""I know!"" and seeing LO frozen because he didn't want to touch Gd's leg to get down, he swooped over and picked him up. LO had a frozen look of terror on his face and stared at me wide eyed. At that point we told Gd not to do that, to please let LO come to him or to ask first if he wants to be picked up. He said ""I took a risk because I wanted to hold him."" (sorry, but what risk did you take? A risk of rupturing the relationship? The risk of making your grandson feel distressed?)  For context, we have encouraged Gd to let LO warm up and come to him, and when he respects this LO will be all over Gd and loving the attention. Gd's wife is fairly respectful, always asking first if LO wants to hold hands etc rather than forcing it because she ""wants"" to. I think as his mother I can see it written all over my son's face that Gd's regularly makes him feel uncomfortable and he tries to withdraw but Gd doesn't see/honour his non-verbal communication until LO is literally crying.

If I am doing tummy time with J, I might also start playing catch with a side beach ball with B to make sure she is getting attention as well, B will try to ride my back like a horse, she’ll put her hands together and put them around my neck and pull herself, all 36 pounds, off the floor, choking me in the process. 

I bought her an indoor slide so she could get out some gross motor energy. I also have a pickler triangle that we are gifting her for Christmas. 

I don’t know what else to do. I am a stay at home mom, so I’m very busy all day keeping up with both kids being fed, clean, and entertained. Every minute we have in the living room or bedroom together is me being clobbered by B. I try to remind her that she needs to be gentle with her touch. I show her gentle touch.

240,AttachmentParenting,"I have posted here recently about the toll my daughter’s hourly or more often wakings is taking on me and my husband’s mental health.

We had our 5 year anniversary yesterday and my in-laws took our 6 month-old baby for the night. We did warn them she would probably wake up often and at least one of those wake-ups would entail a bottle feed.

Turns out, that’s not what happened. She went to bed at 8:30pm, woke up and was awake at 10pm and had to be rocked back to sleep, but then afterwards she only stirred awake once at about 3am, and my brother-in-law who was also visiting my parents and went to use the bathroom heard her and went to check she was okay, and apparently that was enough for her to put hersef back to sleep. She then slept till 7am. 

Now, she was in a separate room whereas she is in our room at home, and from what my brother-i -law said it is clear my in-laws would not have heard her stirrings so she might have woken up more often and gone back to sleep alone, but they would definitely have heard her proper cries and normally at home, we do try to not get up immediately when she stirs, but she will normally escalate it to crying fairly quickly. 

It is also clear that what I suspected for a while is true, that she doesn’t NEED an overnight feed so finds it comforting.

Does this mean I can wean her off nighttime feeds or is this still too early? Any insight would be appreciated! I would KILL for even just one wake-up a night, she stayed with them overnight once before about a month ago when I had to go into hospital and then too, only woke up once, so not sure what I am doing wrong at home except maybe being too quick to breastfeed her.

UPDATE: Just thought some people might be interested to know that we tried putting her to sleep in her travel cot at home and she slept exactly as described by my in-laws, woke up at 10pm, and then stirred a bit in her sleep around 2am but my husband managed to put her back to sleep just by shushing her a bit. She then slept till 6am. Might be a temporary fluke or that she prefers sleeping closer to the ground, so will look into that. 

Wanted to say thank you for those that engaged in good faith with the question, and I hope the few people who insisted it was negligent to have the baby in the room right next to my in-laws’ without a monitor, even though neither of them are deep sleepers and the walls between rooms are paper thin, and insisted that 3 adults probably slept through hours of high-pitched hungry baby crying happening right next to their ears feel better about themselves. 

The weird guilting undertones of those comments implying that I traumatised my baby by doing what everyone suggests to do, “calling in the village” for one night when I am hallucinating due to lack of sleep during the day, was not lost on me. There’s a reason so many mums struggle with asking for help, and things said in the manner those couple of comments were said are exactly the reason why mothers are made to feel bad when they ask for help for the first time in 6 months, when their sanity has reached a breaking point. And I don’t mean everyone who said they probably wouldn’t have heard her stir or every little noise she made, I agreed with those comments, I meant the couple of comments that despite my explanations were weirdly insistent on the fact that the three adults in the house responsible for looking after her simply MUST have been the world’s deepest sleepers, all at the same time, and slept through the hours of shrill, high-pitched full-volume hysterical crying my baby does when she truly is awake and wants to be picked up.",My baby slept through the night for the first time ever…at my in-laws,1668853807.0

He’s never had a problem sleeping in his crib until recently. But now we feed him/comfort him until he falls asleep and he starts to cry once we place him in the crib. Usually immediately, sometimes after about ten minutes. When we pick him up, he falls asleep right away but will only stay asleep if he’s on us. We cannot safely bedshare for a few reasons.

Hi fellow parents. I am looking for your options/validation here. Thank you in advance! 

My boys are very very active - they are constantly on the move. We love it, I think it is cute and good for them. 

So today we went for a 15m check up. We we waiting for our doctor for 30 mins in a tiny room. I did my best to distract them/tell stories/sign, etc, but at some point all they wanted to do was move chairs, go on and off the scale constantly, open the drawers and touch pictures on the walls. I think it is ok to do that as long as they are not damaging anything, 

When our doctor finally arrived, he said they cannot do what they were doing - (constantly going on and off the scale at the moment). They became very upset about it and cried a lot in the next 10-15 minutes of the appointment(and wanted to do all the things they ""can't do"")
He also said that they need to learn to follow instructions and we need to enroll them in some classes so they can learn. 

I feel bad because I had to hold my boys while they were screaming and pushing away the doctor. I hate this. I think pediatricians should be more creative. (Why don't do everything when my boy is on the scale and happy about it?)

 I also don't think they need to follow instructions like ""don't do this and don't do that, and also don't go there, just sit on my lap"". First, I don't want them too follow stupid instructions and kill the creativity. Second, I don't think it is possible to keep them from doing something if they want to do it very much. 
I understand that they need to follow some instructions to ensure their safety, but we try to let our boys do whatever they want unless it hurts anymore or damages anyone's property.

Prior to the 4 month “regression,” she was fine being in the crib then patting her and drifting off to sleep for naps and bedtime. 

But ever since the 4 month “regression,” we haven’t tried to put her in the crib for naps. 

I am going back to work soon (my husband is self-employed from home) so we are actively trying to be consistent with the first nap in the crib, especially now, it seems like she’s starting to having longer than 30 minute naps on her own!

The issue is that we lay her in the crib and rub her head to get her comfy. She’ll lay in the mini crib content, starts to get tired and ends up chomping on her sleep sack and playing with her feet in what builds up to frustration. 

Her eyes are closed (like she’s on the edge of falling asleep) and she starts to fuss and cry. We respond to her by rocking her or holding her for the rest of the nap. 

Should we maybe ditch the sleep sack? Dress her more warmly instead? We used the Zipadee for a bit, too, I’m thinking maybe we could go back to that?

Transfers are usually unsuccessful. We are considering a floor bed since we didn’t even buy the mini crib - it was secondhand from a friend so all we did was as buy the new mattress and sheets.

I know a floor-bed won’t solve all the problems but are transfers usually more successful? We don’t have a nursery for her so we would just have to baby proof our bedroom which we would consider.

If I wasn’t going back to work, contact/carrier/stroller naps wouldn’t be a point of anxiety for me. My husband has to be able to work wearing her for naps but is not necessarily ideal every day for every nap.

After the sun is up she sleeps a lot better, I can get her to sleep up to two hours in the last bit of night sleep, and that's usually all the sleep I get, because I'm up all night anxious about her next wakeup. 

I understand that sleep is developmental but I think what's going on with her is not normal, it's wrong and I've caused it. I've contact napped, coslept, held this baby 24/7 for months. I've slept with her on my chest in bed when that was the only way she'd sleep, I've rocked her for hours (gave myself a bad wrist in the process) and even now that we've made so much progress I still breastfeed back to sleep every time. 

Her pediatrician gave me all these suggestions about night weaning and gentle sleep training that I just know won't work with my baby. She's not one of those babies who can be left alone and will happily doze off. But also I think I've trained her to need me constantly and I'm afraid I'm hurting her development with all the interrupted sleep and how tired she is sometimes. I want to help her and of course get some sleep myself, but I don't know what to do. I have a relationship with her, I can't do something like sleep training that I think would absolutely break her trust in me.

250,AttachmentParenting,"I posted here a week or so ago about my baby’s sleep, or lack of, and while I managed to convince my husband that we are not sleep training, this chronic lack of sleep for the past 6 months has finally caught up with me to the point where I no longer feel like I can be a good daytime parent for my daughter.

My husband and I do as much as we can to ensure we both get SOME sleep, but with hourly wakings that require being rocked to sleep for another 45 minutes, only to be woken up an hour later, there is only so much we can do. Our marriage is practically dead, we have no free time ever in the evenings, and my husband has become depressed because of the half year of basically no sleep we have had. 

I am staying home with my baby and I used to love it: I love her, I love being a mum and I was proud of how attentive I was. She hit all her cognitive milestones early and while that’s probably just luck, I did like to ascribe myself some of the credit for basically being engaged and playing with her all day.

However, for the past couple of weeks, I have been a shit parent. And I can’t be better, because I am exhausted. Shifts are all nice and well but if your baby goes to sleep at 1am and is up at 6am, that is still only 2.5 hours sleep each. 

I have found myself really disengaged from my baby during the day. I am so exhausted I don’t even have the energy to talk to her anymore during the day, I have noticed how quiet I have been recently and how much I scroll through my phone. Besides her bedtime story, can’t remember the last time I read to her during the day. I find myself irrationally angry and irritated when she calls for my attention during the day, because I simply cannot bring myself to speak in baby voice anymore, all I have energy for is staring at the walls. No amount of coffee is able to fix it. So I have become one of those parents that is disengaged and not really there with their baby, and I resent her for it. I find myself going on long walks as that’s when she least requires my attention and I get to be alone with my thoughts.

We have no village or any help. My parents live abroad and my mum visited recently but she wasn’t of much help, and my in-laws only take her when it’s convenient for them. They do look after her a couple of hours some Saturdays, and while I appreciate that, it can’t make up for a chronic lack of sleep, and we are so behind housework normally my husband and I do chores anyway. In fact, nowadays I try to avoid them as much as I can because there is some resentment towards them at the moment, as one of the reasons we moved closer to where they live is because they kept talking about how nice it will be to just “decide” to go on a date night any day of the week and they would take her, which has never happened, not even when we asked for it as they always have something going on and so far they pop around for 15 minutes whenever they want to every week to get their fill of the baby and that’s it. They are also the type who had a lot of help from their own parents when they had their babies, both in the form of support from their own parents and financial support, but they get almost a weird enjoyment from hearing us talk about how hard it is (despite them having live-in help for the entire first year of my husband’s life), and hearing about us struggle financially (despite them literally being cash millionaires who despite knowing we are currently barely making ends meet on only my husband’s salary, always ask us why we don’t just “go on holiday”). 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think they owe us any help with the baby and least of all financially but feel misled by them and can’t really call in “a village” to help with burnout.

However I am wrecked with guilt at how little I have had the energy to do with my baby lately. Is this burn out permanent until I get some rest or do I just get used to it eventually? How can I have more energy to be more present for my baby?

I’m dead tired at this point. To be fair, he was sick all weekend so he was up pretty well all night coughing, which means right now I am way more tired than usual.

253,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all!

This really isn’t a complaint, but rather sharing what my wife and I are going through at the moment. 

Our 7 month old is currently waking up almost every hour. She’s exclusively breastfed and we cosleep. She’ll generally wake up crying and/or screaming and requires nursing and sometimes rocking in order to fall back asleep. 

Prior to a few weeks ago, she’d sleep for 2-3 hour stretches, feed and go right back to sleep. 

We’re attributing this to teething. Seems like her bottom teeth are about to break through but haven’t yet. I imagine that during her sleep cycles, she ends up feeling that pain and finds it hard to drift back to sleep. 

The only way she currently sleeps for longer than ~1 hour stretches is if we contact nap with her. That being said, she’ll still “wake up” but as soon as I get up and rock her a bit she passes out right away.

This is her sleep schedule: she wakes up around 7am and gets out of her toddler bed wanting to nurse. She naps at noon. This usee to be 40 mins but lately it has been closer to 1 hr or 1 hr 20 mins. We have a solid bedtime routine that starts shortly after 7 and she is in bed by 8. If i cut the nap shorter she is tired and irritable all day. She is also tired at the end of the day, asking to go to sleep if we are not initiating it at the usual time. 
 
We put her to sleep by sitting next to her toddler bed. It is dark and rain sounds are playing. The next thing we will try is reintroducing the night light and maybe she would feel more comforatble in there alone if it is not dark. She also sometimes brings up a doll or stuffy to bed with her.

Currently she wakes up around 7, first nap at 10-10:30ish til 11:30 or noon, second nap 4ish til 4:45-5ish, bedtime between 7:30 or 8:30.

For the past 3 weeks or so she'll have a wake up sometime between 2 and 4 and is ready to party...it takes an hour to get her back down. Since DLS this has been every night. Now this weekend we went to my parents and she would not nap. We tried all our tricks and best we could do was one nap around noonish for 90 minutes. 

We survived but she's definitely fragile and overtired by the time she went down for nap and bedtime both days, but it's obviously not fun or fair for anyone to spend over an hour trying to force a nap. I told my husband the better strategy this week will be to try for 15-20 minutes, if it isn't happening, go play for a half hour and try again. 

But what do you think, are we losing the second nap? I'm not ready, my husband is not ready, but maybe she is. Unless we're still dealing with DLS?

In theory, he should be able to go down at 9 and wake up at 8, since that's been his routine, it's just that the clock changed. Well, every morning since the time change, he's started waking up at 7, 6, even 5am, even though he was going down consistently at 9pm. We didn't change a single thing, so I thought he was ready to drop to one nap. He was staying up for 3 hour windows, and 4 hours in the evening. Sometimes he would even skip the second nap. 

So I've been doing one nap for the past 3 days, and this kid is miserable. He's tired and pale all the time. I'm cuddling him a lot more and he's having a much harder time regulating himself than usual. Lots of eye rubbing and yawning. The night sleep has improved, but I can't stand seeing him so miserable.

We talked about how it's okay to be curious about bodies, but that he shouldn't be showing anyone his penis, and nobody should be asking to see his/show him theirs. 


I did some reading and everything I pulled up said this is common behaviour at this age, which I found relieving but told the other mom we would make sure to remind them next time. She was messaging me quite a bit, obviously very concerned. I showed her some of the info I had found hoping to give her peace of mind, but she started talking about discussing it with her social worker friend, and then said that friend suggested we sit down the boys today to go over it. 


I really feel like she's putting a lot of blame on my kid, which is frustrating because her son has had a lot of issues with boundaries and keeping his hands to himself, and of course we both believe our own kids.

I feel like when it comes to baby sleep there’s two major camps: those who sleep trained and have baby sleeping in a crib, and then those who didn’t and coslept.

The parents who sleep trained talk about how their kid has slept great since and is a toddler still sleeping independently. 

And the parents who coslept talk about how they persevered through the wakings and their toddlers are still in bed with them/wake up in the middle of the night and come into bed and how they don’t mind because it’s all part of the parenting journey. 

I’m looking for stories/anecdotes from those in between. From those of you who did NOT sleep train OR cosleep. What happened to those babies? A lot of people say their babies ended up figuring out how to sleep through the night but still need help falling asleep initially. How do those babies end up as toddlers? Does it last?

Some background: I have a 14 month old who recently started sleeping through the night but we still rock/pat her to sleep initially. I was all geared up to sleep train her and then it happened. I’m trying to figure out if this is just a phase and what will happen later on when she goes through regressions, becomes more opinionated about preferences/etc as she grows up. I just don’t want to end up cosleeping or spending hours in the middle of the night in her room trying to get her back to sleep because I never sleep trained.

My baby was naturally inclined to easily fall asleep independently without a dummy/paci with very minimal encouragement - which I know is not typical. He's been preferring to go to sleep like that from about 2 months since I tried ""drowsy but awake"" (because he would always cry as i tried tk soothe him to sleep) and he essentially took to it like a duck to water with very little support, and basically didn't cry when I put him to sleep this way but did when I tried to rock and soothe him all the way to sleep.

272,AttachmentParenting,"For my daughter's entire life, we've been lucky to be able to have my wife work from home. She's always been one or two rooms away from our LO. It made breastfeeding less stressful, they get to see each other regularly throughout the day, etc.

I am primary childcare during the day while my wife works. My background is in education and I love what the attachment model for parenting places focus on. I wish we treated all of our children, at all ages, like actual people with real emotions, unique wants and needs, and unique experiences. School would be a better place if we did this.

Anyhow, we would regularly visit mom throughout the day as she wanted to say hi, eat lunch together, and more.

Lately, at about 20 months, LO has been more anxious about it. As an example, we used to be able to play in her room for quite a while (dancing, cars, etc.) and she was fine. Now, if she so much as hears her mom in her office, she starts to panic, saying ""see you - see you"" over and over again. This is made worse by situations where Mom is completely inaccessible due to a door being closed or when mom is in a meeting.

Our current approach is if she ever wants to ""see"" mom, she just needs to ask, but mom can't stop working to play. We can go to her office and say hi or sit in the office and color or some similar, not disruptive activity.

If I keep her HEAVILY distracted, this anxiety is less of a problem, but often, the moment there's a lull, she'll start chanting ""see you"" until we go visit mom.

I've talked with her about the boundaries, she communicates extremely well for her age, and she can voice her wants/concerns with language really well. She wants to see her mom. She wants to be held and sit on mom's lap. Most of the time this isn't terribly disruptive, but occasionally she'll go into full panic if mom can't hold her and she wants held. We do our best to hold that boundary, and I tell her that we're ""going to go calm down and then come right back"".

We go into another room, I'll rub her back, describe that mom needs to work and I'm sorry she's so upset, remind her mom gets off work after nap, and then eventually go back once she's calmed.

I think, generally speaking, it's gotten better. Leaving the toddler gates in the house open so she can roam freely and not feel trapped helps. These calming sessions help. It seems she's starting to kind of understand mom can't always hold her...

But other times, not.

273,AttachmentParenting,"My toddler is entering a major boundary pushing stage. I want to be able to set and hold boundaries without rupturing our relationship. This sounds simple enough except for my upbringing which I can say left me in fear of ""authority figures"" and feeling very disconnected from my mother aka lonely and sad. I don't want the same thing for my son.

I'm breaking down and analysing and overthinking the different elements of a boundary. Here are my thoughts that I am hoping to hear back on from anyone keen to help.

1. State the boundary eg. If you squirt me with that bottle then I will take it off you. (Keeping it simple or too simple? What voice do I use - sweet, neutral, stern?)

2. Broken boundary response eg. You squirted me with the bottle so now I am taking it off you. (Be calm and gentle, and follow through. Again, the voice?! I hear myself repeating my mother's tone of wanting it to sound like a punishment rather than a consequence and also wanting to sound authoritative).

3. Toddlers reaction to the consequence - support. Here I am practicing staying close, calm and validating feelings eg. You want the water bottle and I took it off you. I hear that you're upset. (I am not talking about the boundary at this point because he is dysregulated). 

4. Repeat the boundary the next time but remind of what happened last time he broke the boundary. Obviously I wait a while before giving him the bottle again for my example.

I think I’m part of the problem…I’ve been following sleep cues this entire time, but I’ve just been nursing him to sleep his whole life lol. Maybe that’s not enough for him anymore, and because I don’t have a whole bedtime/nap time routine he’s struggling? It’s like I’ll see the cues, nurse him, and then he wants to play again.

I never did a dark room either, he just didn’t need it. But I’ve gotten dimmer curtains and a white noise machine. My plan is to read him stories before bed and give him a lovey in the hopes that darkness+white noise+story+lovey = sleep in his mind, and this can carry over into daytime.

287,AttachmentParenting,"As a disclaimer, my husband agrees with AP and has a great bond with our 6 month-old daughter, but we are currently having a disagreement about sleep training and it’s making me really upset. 

I posted yesterday in another subreddit about my daughter being a “bad sleeper”: at 6 months, it still takes us the entire evening to put her down to sleep (we have tried every hour, it makes no difference if we begin at 6 or 10pm), and once she falls asleep, she will be up at least 2 times before we ourselves go to bed. Afterwards, on good days, she will wake up every 2 hours at night. On bad nights like last night she woke up at 10pm and did not go back to sleep till 2am.

The lack of sleep is exhausting, but I think what’s even worse is the fact we have no time together in the evenings at all. By the time she has gone to sleep, we are both exhausted. This is starting to affect him as he’s telling me he needs time with me too. 

He knows I don’t agree with sleep training but he says he is willing to take her and do it for however long it takes while I sleep with headphones on. His argument is that if the goal is to avoid her crying and being stressed, she is already stressed anyway and cries all throughout putting her to sleep without any sleep training, so how would him “training her” without leaving her in the “gentle sleep training” ways be any different.

Would appreciate any advice - we are at an impasse. I do not want to sleep train but this is affecting my marriage negatively, and my husband is going through a lot at the moment and needs me too.

He slept great originally in his bassinet, would go right back to bed after nightly feeds, but would only nap if you held him. Then, he stopper doing so good in his bassinet and we moved him pretty early on into his crib and he seemed more comfortable but it took leaning over his crib and holding a pacifier in his mouth to get him to adjust.

We currently live in a 1 bedroom apartment so can’t move toddler to her own room. It has a whole host of other issues (including no parking, no outdoor space, such poor insulation that our bills are horrible and a non functioning bathroom). Our landlord is also terrible. Anyway that’s an aside - but our lease ends in February and we can move! Yay. 

But I will have another baby by then. My 2 year olds is a low sleep needs, high other needs baby. She has always bedshared with us and never slept in her cot her whole life. Her sleep is poor. It can take up to 2 hours to get her to sleep for naps and bedtime and sometimes she just doesn’t nap. She only sleeps tucked right up inside my armpit the whole night and gets very angry and upset if I move. She wakes 2-4 times a night. 

Anyway, I knew we had to get her out of our bed before baby 2 because I am completely prepared to cosleep with that one. 

I’ve tried a side car crib but our daughter just climbs right out of it into the bed without even trying to sleep. She climbs out of a cot so that isn’t an option. 

So I set up her toddler bed on the other side of the room and last night just said, let’s go for it. Let’s try. Completely expecting failure. 

Well expect my shock when after only a 3 hour stint of me sat on the floor and her refusing to even lie in the bed, an EXHAUSTED child eventually relented and lay in the toddler bed. She needed me half lying in the bed stroking her hair which was very uncomfortable! (It’s not a floor bed and is small). I do want to get a floor bed but can’t justify it so close to moving. 

Anyway I cried my eyes out for a while because it was emotional. But then 2 hours later she got out of the toddler bed and SCREAMED. Like screamed like she was in extreme pain. She kept getting out of the bed and coming into my arms :(. I sat by the bed and was able to carry her back in 10 times or so before it got very difficult for me and she was still screaming horrendously. I caved and brought her into our bed where she quickly settled (so I know it wasn’t discomfort/teething/etc) but was constantly checking I was still there. 

What do I do? It was a losing battle trying to get her back into the bed and she was beyond distressed  My husband can’t help because he works late every day and honestly she mostly wants me. 

Should I just persevere? She sounded too distressed and it was difficult for me but I feel like I took two steps back already.

I usually make our dinner at work, and if I am making meals at home I include her in the processes that are safe. The thing is, she just wants to be held. Wearing her doesn't work in the house.  
Making dinner is one thing, but then there's the clean up. She stands behind me and whines until I stop cleaning. Again, I involve her in everything.

I've taken to setting 10 minute timers, and talking to her through it, ""mummy just needs 10 minutes to get our space clean again, you can go and play in the living room if you want, or you can sit in here with me and we'll sing songs while we clean"" this will difuse her for a minute, then she'll start again, I tell her how long is left on the timer, and repeat my process. I'd like some feedback on this approach as I feel it is a gentle way for me to set this boundary.

I struggle with tidying the house in general,  especially when she needs me in bed with her all night. If I've not coslept the night before I will wake up at 5 to get the house clean and get activities planned for the day, but if I've had to cosleep with her (neither of us sleep well when we do this, but if she's ill she just wants to be held, and I'm not going to say no to that) I don't get that chance to get ahead for the day.

Does anyone else feel like before they had their babies, they weren’t necessarily an ultra warm, affectionate, lovey-dovey person but found a surprising sense of achievement and fulfillment within motherhood? 

Before I had my baby, my husband’s nickname for me was literally “Ice Queen”, because although deeply loyal and always there for the people I love, I am not always good at showing that affection. I don’t really like being touched, so not massively into cuddles, I am not I guess what others would picture when they think of a comforting, maternal figure, I was very career-oriented, very big into my hobbies etc.

Always wanted a baby, but this thought that I was “unmumsy” kept haunting me throughout my pregnancy. The very fact that we have an image of what a motherly person looks like, as if just one type of person can be a good mother is an issue, and I didn’t feel like I fit the stereotype.

However since my baby was born I have been so happy and fulfilled, and, dare I say it, “mumsy”. In my own way, but maternal and warm and caring nonetheless.

I never thought I would be able to speak in baby voice, I assumed I would need lots of time away from my baby and would be touched out every day, but have found the opposite to be true: I love contact naps and cuddles, I DO speak in that sickeningly sweet tone to my baby all day and while of course I need breaks, by the end I am so looking forward to being with my baby again. 

My friends and family have commented on that surprised tone that motherhood seems to really suit me, which I know also comes from the fact I am not seen as a “warm” person, but I take it as a compliment, because for once, I AM proud of the mother I am growing into. 

This post is not a humble brag, I am not saying I am a “natural” mother, quite the opposite, I am plagued by anxiety most days, still learning, make mistakes and have my breaking points, but as mothers we tend to be hyper critical and rarely see the good things we do, so just wanted to celebrate all of us who had been boxed into the “not very motherly”, “not very warm” categories and who are great mothers who try to do their best by their babies everyday.",Any other “unmumsy” mums out there?,1666692712.0

We’ve been rocking (bouncing) my 18 month old to sleep almost every day of his life. We have an exercise ball in his room and we use it for naps, bedtime, and night wakeups. He needs to be bounced around 10-15 minutes every time. My son is a climber and I’m sure he’ll be able to climb out of his crib shortly at which point we’ll convert to a toddler bed. I’m just envisioning needing to bounce him on our exercise ball for years still because I’ve created this dependency on him going to sleep this way. It’s getting cumbersome needing to bring an inflatable exercise ball with us everytime we go on a trip and if he’ll be able to get out of his own toddler bed soon (which I imagine will include a lot of getting out of bed and running around), walking him back to bed will likely require bouncing back to sleep.

322,AttachmentParenting,"Twin toddler tantrums - help!

Posting on behalf of a friend.

She is unsure about how normal her twin boys behaviour is and we can't work out how to google it. 

Boys are 2.5 years old. They are showing strong parental preference and swap between wanting mum and dad all the time (we know this is normal). 

She is unsure about this - when they are showing preference for one parent and the other does something, the tantrums will escalate and continue until the other parent does the thing for them. 

Eg. Dad preference - Mum unbuckles boy from the car and brings him inside. Tantrum follows and escalates and no amount of distraction or anything will stop it until Dad takes him back out to the car and gets him out. 

This happens with lots of things - want mum to fill their bottle but dad does and tantrum until mum re does it, want dad to walk them up the stairs but mum does and tantrum until dad walks them back down and then up the stairs. 

Is this just them asserting their independence? We have talked about how boundaries need to be set - it's mums turn to do this today, dad will have a turn tomorrow, while still being their for them through the big feelings.

For context he sleeps in a cot in his own room, we do book, bath, feed (sometimes rock if still awake) then bed. He is entirely best fed. 
He was previously sleeping stretches between 4-6 hours before waking for a feed. Then would sleep roughly 2 hours, feed and down for another hour, however by the second waking would be hard to put back down and we would often finish sleep in the recliner chair just so he could get more sleep.

The longest stretch of sleep he will have while in the chair is 3 hours, other than that he is constantly fidgeting and waking.

I have had appointments with two different doctors out of desperation, the first one cut me off mid sentence and said it's teething (without even looking at his gums) and to wait it out (I will add that I do think he has started teething just in the last few days). The second one lectured me that I have created bad habits and that I need to let him cry it out at night. 
She is probably right and I have created this habit. I just wanted my baby to get the best sleep he can. My husband is a loud snorer and deep sleeper and will even roll on me in his sleep so co sleeping isn't safe. I am failing my beautiful boy and I am just at breaking point both mentally and physically from lack of sleep. I am getting frustrated and I have had to put him down and walk away on occasion because I am worried that I will hurt him out of frustration.

336,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all! I'm a firm believer in attachment parenting. I've read some amazingly insightful books such as ""The whole-brain child"" and deeply care about doing right by my kids.
We currently have 4 boys (11y, 9y, 5y, 1 1/2y).

My challenge is that my 5year old screams, screeches, and yells, whenever he is angry or frustrated. And obviously that's because he doesn't know a better way to handle these big feelings yet, but I have tried time and time again to try to get him to express his feelings in a calmer way.

So I would absolutely love to hear what worked for others. How did you finally help your easily flustered child find better ways to handle and process those big, uncomfortable feelings? I want to get better at helping him and give him the tools he needs. He is such an amazing person but good grief can a child produce noise 😅

337,AttachmentParenting,"I feel like I need to vent my frustration in a safe space and this community is most likely to not judge. I am so sick and tired of getting side eyed and even gasps of horror when I tell other parents or pediatricians that I bed share with my 1 year old. There's so so much research out there to support safe bedsharing practices. Also, she doesn't even sleep with us every night, most of the time she sleeps happily in her toddler floor bed in her room through the night. Lately, she has been having a bit of a tough time, so she wakes up around 3, walks into our room and spends the rest of the night with us. I recently revealed this to a childcare worker at the playgroup we go to who asked me how toddler has been sleeping, and she laughed at me, saying my daughter's old enough to cry it out and shame on me for not teaching her how to self soothe back to sleep.

What a crock of shit. I really didn't want to get into it with her, but I said that the concept of children under the age of 5 really being able to self soothe is a very controversial topic. She kind of rolled her eyes at me when I said that, and so did another parent who was listening into the conversation.

It really gets me pissed off. I would never tell a parent outright that what is working for their family is the wrong thing to do, even though honestly, traditional sleep training horrifies me. I read comments on reddit about parents letting their kids cry at night until they throw up, or their voice is hoarse, and other parents just saying ""good job for sticking it out"" in response.

338,AttachmentParenting,"I have an almost 10 month old and I am wanting to change our sleep/bedtime routine and need some advice. TLDR at the end.

Some background:

Baby slept in a bassinet next to mine and husband’s bed until about 6 months old, then he was too tall to fit comfortably in the bassinet and I had started putting him next to me on our bed to sleep as he seemed to enjoy that and sleep better, which I admit made me nervous and I know goes against safe sleep recommendations and I felt guilty but I don’t move when I’m asleep and tried to make it as safe as I could.

My husband was complaining that he didn’t have much room on the bed (we have a queen) and I felt it was time to transition baby to his own room.

The idea I had was to skip a crib and get a floor bed and baby proof his room, so that’s what we did but when I bought the floor bed I thought it should last him as long as possible and bought a full size bed frame. Got a firm mattress from IKEA which I then realized is not ideal either.

Well, ever since we set up the bed I’ve been sleeping with the baby on it and it makes it so easy to breastfeed sidelaying through the night and just being right there. I like it! Now here’s the BUT, baby still wakes up sometimes 3-4 times during the night to nurse and it’s not too bad most night but I’ve found myself wishing I could sleep through the night again, and also for baby’s sake (I mean, is it better for babies too? Does he need to start learning that now?) and the other BUT is that I do miss sleeping with my husband and he misses me and makes comments about it often.

The issue is that I hate getting out of bed when I am tired and coming over to baby’s room to nurse him, then get up and go back to my bed, sometimes multiple times per night. 

Also, I am nervous of leaving baby for too long as I am used to being with him pretty much 24/7. The floor bed is not perfect and I’m scared he will somehow get trapped or suffocate which I know can of course happen with me sleeping next to him too, I know I’m not being rational and that’s part of why I need some advice.

Pediatrician recommended  a “gentle” Ferber method (waiting more days to increase time) but I just can’t bring myself to do it, my instinct is to comfort baby as soon as I can when he is crying.

I don’t want to instill bad habits and I want a more harmonious sleep/bedtime for my whole family. What to do?

TLDR: I sleep with baby on floor bed and he still wakes up 3-4 times per night to nurse. I want to go back to sleeping with husband in our bed but am nervous to leave baby alone and lazy to have to get up every time baby cries at night.",Advice on sleeping situation,1666045649.0
339,AttachmentParenting,"19 month old was very whiny and demanding today around lunch time. I got him fed and started to clean up. He asked for water and I offered a drink bottle because I was cleaning up lunch. He got upset and asked for a cup. I told him if he wanted a cup to wait a few minutes. Then when I offered the cup he said no. So I said ok and put the cup aside. He got upset. 

I stuffed up here by being too tired and pissy to just stop and be with him. I started doing dishes while he escalated. I told him to be quiet please, go find a book to read. I shouted at him. He escalated. Because of me. 

It ended up as a 15 minute tantrum that I could only settle him from with a walk outside. He settled quickly once outside.

We came back in after about 20 minutes and he asked for boob, and by now we were past nap time, so we went to the bedroom and laid in bed. I offered him boob and he straight away tantrumed. 

This one last 25 minutes, with thrashing around and screaming/crying. All attempts to soothe him or even just be quiet and waiting resulted in more escalation. 

I eventually settled him by using a firm voice, holding him close and having both boobs out. He likes to have a hand on one boob whilst feeding from the other, which I don't normally allow because I find it uncomfortable. But he was able to settle by touching and then having boob.  He fell asleep in my arms. 

I totally fucked up today. I couldn't deal with my own shit and he spiralled in his own big emotions plus mine. He has never tantrumed like that before and I take full responsibility for it. 

Is this repairable? Have I completely stuffed up our relationship? What should I do for the rest of the day? Do I need to go overboard with attention? And will falling asleep after the tantrum reinforce his brain patterns to strengthen those messy circuits that causes the tantrum?

During the week my mom watches him (M, W, F) while I work and do house chores etc. and yet I often let him sleep over her house on weekends (she asks/offers) because I am sooooo burnt out after one or two full days in a row lately. He’s getting his last molars and has been having a lot of feelings lately - hitting, pulling hair, screaming at me. I am happy with how I respond to him in the moment but I get burnt out so quickly.

346,AttachmentParenting,"We co-slept and breastfed since day one with both our daughters. They’re now 5 and 2.5 years old and have been weaned a long time, and they sleep in a bed right next to our bed. They often climb over into our bed late in the night / early in the morning and snuggle with us until it’s time to wake up. My husband and I and our daughters all like our situation as we all sleep better this way with less interruptions, and I rest better knowing they’re nearby. 

What **isn’t** working for us is how long bedtime takes. When they were little I would breastfeed them until they fell asleep and it’s just how we’ve always done it since. They both go to bed later (around 8:30/9 pm, and trying any earlier just makes it take longer), and some nights after we turn off the lights and lay next to them and sing lullabies it can take anywhere from 15-45 minutes for them to fall asleep. If we try to get up and out of their bed before they’re totally asleep then they’ll cry out.

350,AttachmentParenting,"After nearly 6 months, I reached my breaking point today. 

I guess you could say this has been brewing for a while and it all kicked off this morning. My nearly 6 month-old has not been sleeping for longer than one hour stretches at night since she was three and a half months old. She wakes up every 45 minutes to an hour, and I have just been dealing with it. My husband and I both, in shifts, neither of us getting any reasonable amount of sleep for months. 

She is also a velcro baby and I love that, normally. Except, she hates babywearing. Yep, we tried everything: hundreds of $ wasted on trying to find something she will tolerate, but she is just not into it. She is fine being held in my arms, or me sitting down and playing with her or lying next to her in bed. In fact, God forbid I ever do anything else but pay her my undivided attention. Again, normally, this is fine. I love spending time with her. 

But when you have been operating on 3 hours sleep total per night for the past two and a bit months, and you can’t go to the toilet or even put your disgusting oily hair in a bun, because your baby will start crying, it’s all a bit much.

My husband commutes to work twice a week, and those days I am alone from 5:30am till 8pm. Add to this my nightly shift and I easily do 90% of the childcare those days. Not anything that can be changed but just the reality of my life. These days are tough as it is but my baby didn’t sleep all night (she might have dozed off twice for 30 minutes each), I got up at 5:30am, and went downstairs to let the dog out. I had asked my husband to help with tidying before he leaves today in exchange for me doing all the childcare last night as baby was being fussy and only wanted me. Instead, I found the couch had a massive poo stain my husband was aware of but hadn’t cleaned, the dining room was covered in dog poo he had similarly not cleaned (our dog is house trained but has had a bug and been sick - I asked him to check throughout the house to make sure we didn’t miss anything), the kitchen floors are a mess, and I know I won’t get around to doing any of this today. 

I went to put her down to have a glass of water and to be honest, I lost it. She started screaming and for the first time ever, I felt just rage and anger. I wanted to scream back in her face. I haven’t slept all night, I will be alone with her for the next 13 hours, I can never catch a break and it feels like everyone else’s houses are cleaner and tidier. And now I can only drink water when she naps. 

I put her in her cot with a toy and went downstairs. I just screamed, and ignored her cries. Came back 15 minutes later, put her in her pillow chair, sat down where I could watch her and ignored her for the next hour while she grumpily played alone. 

I am so ashamed. Feel like the worst mum ever. I was so angry at her, I wanted to SCREAM in her face. I have never felt rage towards my baby. 

I am consumed with so much guilt and shame and just sat on the bed crying as she naps. Didn’t think I was capable of this much self-hatred. No idea what to do with her for the next 12 hours after this.",It finally happened. I reached my breaking point and let my baby cry.,1665558291.0

As we have told him to stop, he has started harming him in other ways when we cannot see him. For example, if we're not able to see their feets, he will step on him. He will pinch him, push him, kick him, put his finger in his eyes or mouth, hit him in the face with toys, the list is endless. I cannot leave them alone for 1 minute and he is hurting him.

We try as much as we can to tell him that's not ok, we try to be as serious as we can, but he will even smile!!! Sometimes laugh a bit.

Like the title says, I have a 3 month old and a 22 month old. I'm a stay at home mom. We're middle class. I love my husband, I love my children, and my expectations of myself being a stay at home mom were way different from my reality. I had no idea that I would struggle this much mentally or miss the idea of ""freedom"" so much. Prior to children, I really thought this was going to be the biggest joy of my life and all I wanted to accomplish, but now I feel like my sanity and state of mind is all I can focus on other than keeping my children alive and making sure they're thriving. My 3 month old has colic issues and I cannot put them down or leave them alone when they're awake and conscious for more than 15 minutes at the long end. They have gas issues and I often have to deal with a screaming baby/screaming toddler at the same time. I have sensory processing disorder which makes crying extra difficult for me.

  


(edit: I FEEL like) I'm constantly letting my husband down with the language I use when I need help or when I'm struggling. I'll say things like ""She turns evil at naptime, she bit me"", ""I need a break from \*insert daughters name here\*, ""I just miss my old life"", and I'll often break down in shambles or tears, even worse when he corrects me or expresses that this language doesn't work for him in our marriage or how we run our family. I don't like this language that I use either, but it's insanely hard when I feel like I'm in crisis to pause and think about how I'm saying things. In turn, I then feel like the primary focus in my life, the ONLY thing I'm doing, is just constant strugglebus or a combination of tripping and falling and I struggle with feeling fulfilled, valued, or even just a good mom.

  

I feel like the constant shift throughout the day of ""Wow, my children are so precious, look what a miracle I have, look how far I've come"" to ""Holy fucking shit, how am I going to survive, I want to run away and never return and shave my head off"" is such a swirl that it hurts my brain. I love my life, I truly do, but my emotions and burnout get the best of me sometimes and I can feel like everything is crumbling and I need a mental institution.

I have a 2.5 year old and 3 month old who I am practicing attachment parenting with. Toddler was born during the pandemic and we kept a really tight bubble until we felt comfortable putting into daycare. Last week she started and caught her first cold. Started with a runny stuffy nose and then spiked a fever. She’s good at blowing her nose when it’s full but it breaks my heart that she’s in discomfort and can’t breathe and there’s nothing I can do to help her.

I’ve been keeping my distance with the 3 month old to avoid her getting sick but last night she started to have a stuffy nose and had a terrible sleep. I have a hydra sense nasal aspirator which I will try when she wakes up (currently sleeping on my chest). Does anyone have any tips to help with nasal congestion? I’m worried because I’ve never had to deal with a cold before and she’s so little. 

Because I’ve been keeping my distance from my 2.5 year old - husband has been primary caregiver while she’s been sick - she said to me last night “Mama doesn’t like to play with me anymore. Mama doesn’t love me. Papa loves me.” It broke me. I’ve done my best to explain to her why I’m keeping my distance and that I love her very much.

367,AttachmentParenting,"Hi team, I’m struggling hard. 

My 2 year old has always needed a lot of assistance to fall asleep. She was nursed to sleep for 15 months, or grandma could occasionally bounce her to sleep. 

Even these methods would take up to an hour and sometimes wouldn’t work. 

We cosleeep. I’ve tried a cot but it never works and she can climb out of it anyway. She still wakes in the night but settles with a cuddle. 

It’s not teething, or sleep progressions, or wake windows, or over tired or under tired because it happens every single nap and some bed times. 

It’s the same battle. 3+ hours of me lying in bed with her while she climbs over me, runs around, runs out of the room, cries. About 50% of the time she eventually falls asleep after several hours of this. The other half she doesn’t nap and is a grumpy wreck by bedtime. 

My mom, who looks after her when I’m at work, also struggles with a few hours of on/off bouncing her on a ball or rocking her on a pillow. Dad does the same. This is all associates with a lot of crying and screaming. I can’t bounce her on a ball due to pain issues. 

I’ve tried layering sleep associations and removing them but it’s not like anything worked in the first place. I’ve tried white noise and blackout blinds and running around and lots of food and longer and shorter wake windows and songs and nursing and bum pats but she doesn’t want to sleep. 

Naps are worse than bed time. 

I CAN’T spend 4-5 hours of my day in battles with this girl not sleeping. I can’t do it anymore. I end up in tears the days I’m home with her because I hate nap time so much. 

I’m convinced this is my fault for not trying harder with the cot or not having a strict routine or something. I have a LOT of baby friends and NONE of them are like this. They all magically leave their kids in the cot and they go to sleep??? Or take 20 minutes to sleep??

I need help. I don’t want to cry it out (it wouldn’t work anyway, she’d just jump out of the cot). Should I hire a sleep consultant? Is it too late to implement a routine? What can I do?

378,AttachmentParenting,"I am just done. I have no idea what to do. I posted last week as baby’s sleep was all over the place for the last 3 months. Well it got worse. 

He wakes every 27-32 minutes. Day or night time. If he is in my arms, his cot, dads arms, cot mattress on the floor with me sleeping next to him (which I feel anxiety doing but needs must) or pram/car seat. He’ll wake, scream/cry, roll around in his cot/my arms, he’ll grab hair/clothes/face and pull/hit. And then 15 minutes later he’ll be back to sleep. 

He’s always been a great night sleeper. Day has always been iffy. He’s been waking between 4-5am for months (9-10 hours at night with one feed) and I was about to test a one nap day to see if that helped with short naps and early morning wake ups. 

Then this started. It’s day 4 and I’m a zombie. We are splitting it as much as possible but my OH works full time so I’m on my own in the day and we split the night.  He’s due to go on a work trip and will try to move but will have to travel eventually.  

Baby is eating and drinking fine. He’s playing as normal but very tired. No teeth coming in, temperature fine and nappy output is normal. I’ve given Calpol but no difference. I’m going to book a GP appointment tomorrow to have his ears checked.  

Has anyone had this before? Is it a regression, an illness, separation  anxiety? I just had to leave him crying in his cot for 10 minutes because nothing I do helps and I’m crying too. He threw up as he screamed so much he coughed and choked. 

He’s asleep in my arms now but starting to stir as it’s been 26 minutes. So the cycle begins again.

EDIT: another decidedly iffy night but we got one 2 hour stretch from 3-5am which has made all the difference. 

Saw the GP and his ears/nose/throat are all fine. He also listened to his chest/lungs and checked his oxygen as it’s the start of flu season but all good on that front. He’s put on weight (no wonder my arms are hurting!) and GP agrees food/milk/nappies are all fine and in line with his %tile. Looks like it’s just a regression which I’m glad about as he’s not sick. 

Got a group appointment with my Health Visitor tomorrow afternoon so they can watch him play with three other babies for an hour or so and chat with me. Just in case they spot anything out the ordinary but it all sounds good so far on his health front which is what was giving me anxiety.

We bed share, Have been since day 1. But lately, if I slip out of bed (to do some chores, work, or whatever), she almost instantly wakes up. This is  new; used to be she‘d rouse a little but go back to sleep. If she cries, Usually I can go attend to her, but sometimes I can’t.

She was probably full on sobbing for almost an hour! 

Believe me when I say she hasn’t always been like this. When she was younger, my husband could put her back to sleep no problem. But now it seems like she wants the boob and nothing else will do. 

There have been a few changes recently. Firstly, my husband went back to work a couple weeks ago, so our schedules changed pretty drastically. I’m now watching her a lot more than I used to.  Her grandmothers (whom she adores) watch her for about 8 hours a week while I work. Otherwise it’s either me or my husband watching her.

386,AttachmentParenting,"If you’re on the breastfeeding sub, please forgive the crosspost. But there’s some emotional/attachment parenting issues afoot with this that I could use some advice on. Plus folks on this sub generally seem to have more experience with longer-term breastfeeding.

So my kid picked up a nasty case of RSV and nursing has taken a total nose dive because she’s SO congested. On top of it, she’s now brewing an ear infection according to the doctor. It’s been almost a week of this and my production is quickly tanking (I also got my period today, which always affects my production). 

The issue here is she’s unintentionally weaning because it’s uncomfortable to nurse due to all the congestion. And because we’re late in the breastfeeding game (she just turned 3), it’s not like I was producing a ton anyway. So the margin of error here is small. 

My issue is twofold - on the one hand, it would be super cool if I could get *some* breast milk into her because I know it would help her feel better faster. And alas… my breast milk is high lipase so she’ll only drink it from the source. On the other hand, I think if I allow weaning to happen during this illness, she’s going to be unhappy when she feels better that the milk is gone and it will be unnecessarily traumatic to both of us. 

I’d rather wean on our terms and not because she’s sick. 

Realistically, how much pumping should I do to try and get my production back up? She was only nursing like 3x/day prior to this illness, so just…. Replace those sessions? Or would power pumping be the better choice here and do that a few times a day? Or do I need to go nuclear and pump every few hours?

Also, has anybody had a breastfeeding relationship sort of… fall apart during illness and then come back? 

I just. Sigh. I really don’t want this to be how breastfeeding ends for us. I’m pretty heartbroken over it, especially because she loved nursing before she got sick and the only reason she’s not doing it as often or as effectively is because she’s been so sick.

ETA: There seems to be some confusion about why my kid is refusing to nurse, so I’ll clarify here. She’s been so congested she can’t nurse, which makes her cry hysterically. Then because she’s crying, she produces so much mucus that she starts coughing and choking on it, and then throws up. She woke up from a nap just yesterday wanting to nurse and couldn’t, then sobbed because she was afraid to throw up again. I didn’t articulate this very well in the original post because I’m also quite sick with RSV and my primary concern is just solving the problem.

390,AttachmentParenting,"Hi folks,

I've been having a really hard time with my 7 month old's sleep. We've traveled recently- away two weeks, home 1 week, away almost 3 weeks. He's gotten discombobulated and has regressed from being able to fall asleep in his crib (with some pats and shushing) and sleeping several hours at a time to waking almost every hour. Last night out of desperation I nursed him every two hours because it always puts him back to sleep for a bit. All his naps (2 a day now, totalling 3-4 hours) are contact naps.
My husband is going back to work in a few weeks after his leave and we need to get him sleeping better. We're committing to the pick up put down method because neither of us are down with crying it out. We're starting today for naps and night sleep. I don't know if this is too much change at once, but I also think that contact naps during the day get him accustomed to sleeping in my arms and maybe confuses him. 
Anyone have any success stories or tips? We are exhausted. I know the next few days will probably suck.. but short term pains for long term gains, right??",Pick up put down method,1664300848.0

392,AttachmentParenting,"[apols for cross posting with r/breastfeeding] so I know you should really try not to wake a sleeping baby (unless you're on a medically recommended feeding schedule) and feed on demand, but if you have a baby sleeping on you, unfortunately you have slightly more influence over when they wake up than you'd like, and it affects other factors like your own ability to sleep or go to the toilet or whatever.

context: my baby is 3.5 months old (10 weeks adjusted) and has a mix of nursing and pumped breastmilk via bottle. he's now healthy, 60th % for his adjusted age and good diaper output. unfortunately I don't feel able to bedshare because of his prematurity and my anxiety - I'm on meds and incredibly sleep deprived which a) makes it riskier and b) even if it was theoretically safe, my anxiety probably wouldn't let me sleep anyway. we try to put him down in his sidecar crib overnight with one of us next to him with a hand on him, but that has variable results. i'm not looking for advice on sleep training though, we are going at our own pace and just looking for advice in the meantime while we work on independent sleep. i'm still on maternity leave for the foreseeable future but my husband has just had to go back to work 3 weeks ago. the baby seems to be able to go anywhere between 5-7hrs between feeds for his first stretch of the night, which i know is actually quite developmentally advanced for his age, but he can't independently stay asleep the whole time yet. after that first stretch he's usually back to going 2-3hrs between feeds. since he was premature we've always had some issues with him being too sleepy to feed, he was in NICU on a schedule and feeding tube for a while and then only allowed to go max 5hrs at night for a while when we first got home and he used to be great at crib sleeping. but then since his 6 week growth spurt he keeps having phases of needing contact sleep (which is quite common and protective for preemies).

so, the baby and I usually go up to start the bedtime routine about 8.30-9ish, his choice, and he'll get to sleep by about 10-11 depending how it all went. he can either wake up after an hour/one sleep cycle or at any random time in the night. we try all the crib soothing etc, but as soon as we resort to picking him up, he often instantly falls right back asleep in our arms. 9/10 if we try to put him back down again without feeding him, regardless of how long we wait or what transfer method, he'll wake up. but if I let him contact sleep on me, he could easily stay asleep there for hours and hours longer. the trouble is, then i'm not getting sleep. the only time i can be guaranteed to get some sleep on a week day is between about 5-6 and 8.30 when my husband takes a shift before work, so, if the baby needs to eat during the night, which i'm pretty sure he still does, ideally i'd feed him around 3am so i can try to put him back down, he might then stay asleep til it's my husband's turn, and i can try to get as much sleep as possible before 8.30. but often when 3am comes round, he's still asleep on me and can easily stay there til 5-6am if i don't move him. by that time he might be stirring and showing hunger cues in his sleep but often he still doesn't properly wake up unless i put him down because i need the loo or to hand him off to his dad so i can go to sleep. but by then i only get 2-3hrs sleep before i'm back on baby duty, and he's even worse at needing contact naps during the day so i don't get to nap then either. if i do put him down though, pretty much any time after 1am, he wakes up, realises he's hungry and cries, screaming louder the longer he's gone since a feed. i've tried dream feeding but it either properly wakes him up or he doesn't feed effectively, either from the boob or the bottle, he's never been good at feeding while he's sleepy. 

so, what would you do? 
- try putting him down again as soon as possible to try and prioritise encouraging independent sleep, but risk him waking up and wanting to feed earlier and more frequently than he might really need to, 
- let him contact sleep for a bit but wake him up at 3/some scheduled time to compromise between his sleep and prioritising my sleep,
- accept/be prepared for one of us being awake and try to let him contact sleep as long he wants to before he wakes up out of hunger, to prioritise him getting the sleep he needs and learning to only wake up when he's really hungry 

i would prefer to do what's best for him developmentally rather than whatever's most convenient for us, but i also know that if i don't get enough sleep I won't be as sensitive and responsive a parent he needs when i'm awake 🤷‍♀️ i'm trying to get more help with the anxiety and researching if/when bedsharing might become a relatively safer option than sleep deprivation, and as i say, we're working on independent sleep as much as we can, but i just don't know how much of a priority that is over the other factors given that it's entirely biologically and developmentally normal for a baby like him to need contact sleep.

We had been getting by for the longest time with exclusive contact/carrier naps but after her recent growth spurt she is literally too big to comfortably lay on my chest anymore so I have lost that method of comforting her. My ability to feed her to sleep and then roll away seems to have disappeared overnight...she wakes up as soon as I take the boob out of her mouth. 

I've been resorting to sitting with her, shushing and jiggling as she cries in her crib and it's really not going well.

397,AttachmentParenting,"I've (28F) got a little boy (9 months). So I've been pretty set on attachment parenting from the start and it's absolutely had it's challenges.

My little boy can be very clingy, doesn't like being put down, needs support to sleep etc and motherhood has been very draining, to say the least. I've had maybe 3 or 4 uninterrupted nights since he was born (breastfeeding) and feel like he's constantly attached to me, which I love but it's also very difficult to get anything done.

My Mum has been very supportive for the most part, however, has made comments in the past that I'm sure we're all familiar with (he's got you wrapped around hits little finger/he's only crying because he knows you'll come/crying won't do him any harm/you don't have to pick him up straight away/maybe he'd sleep better if you let him cry for a bit/he's too attached to you etc). My Mum respects how we choose to parent and although she doesn't always agree, she will do things the way we ask. However, she has insinuated that AP is too soft and we're coddling him.

Anyway, I've started a few practice days back at work and my Mum looked after him today. I've barely been away from him since he was born and never for that long during the day, but he coped fantastic, especially considering he's teething! When I came home, my Mum said she'd never seen a baby that's so securely attached and cope so well with being left like that. There were no tears when I left him and he's been fine without me. It just made me feel so good, like all of this effort and work and tiredness and everything has been worth it. And it felt so much better coming from someone who I know doesn't entirely agree with AP 😂

She’s really easy to put to sleep that way. She naps on the floor bed in her nursery and starts the night there until we are ready to sleep. She always wakes up around two hours after she goes to bed and that’s when we bring her into our bed and I nurse her back to sleep. 

I’m okay with all of that, but the trouble starts around 2-3am when she wants to nurse and basically use me as a pacifier for the rest of the night while her little hand tries to play with the other nipple.

She was nursed to sleep and overnight until she was maybe 2 and a few months. We went to no overnight. Soon went away from nurse to sleep. Still sat with her and held her hand or sat nearby.

This was amazing to me - rather then taking 2 hours it took ten minutes. 

Anyways we alternated for a while between her still falling asleep nursing and me sitting with her while she feel asleep on her own, normally depending on how tired she was. 

More and more nights she was sleeping through the night , I would see her get up and get herself settled again on the monitor.

First - our house is two levels with the master upstairs and her bedroom downstairs. It’s the farthest you can walk in the house to go from one to the other.

My 13 month old decided a few months ago that they no longer wanted to be rocked or held to sleep. I felt both relieved and sad at this transition, but was happy they were showing independence. They instead lay in their crib independently, and put themselves to sleep using a lovey and a pacifier (occasionally needing pats or back rubs).  It usually took 10-15 minutes for them to fall asleep, with no crying or fussiness. 

The past few weeks, however, it takes 30-60 minutes for them to fall asleep, and they now like to play the game of throwing their pacifier(s) out of the crib, then crying until I give them back. Then repeat. And repeat… and repeat.

Her little eyes just kept staring into space like she was traumatized. I felt so awful that she'd just given up on crying after a few minutes. 

She's only a month old. I know she's not in any less need for me just because she stopped crying. She may even be a bit traumatized. These experiences make me think again about sleep training.

No one would recommend I do that to her as a newborn.

For background, I'm in therapy and practicing CBT and gentle/mindful parenting.

Today, when I was putting my 21 month old down for a nap, my 2 month old started crying and I had to bring her into the bed to nurse her.  My 21mo has been having slight issues during naptime recently, (I think she's going to drop the nap soon) but was calm prior to me bringing the baby in. Once I brought the baby in, all hell broke loose. She starting laughing and thrashing her body. At first, I was able to stay calm and just redirect her down to the bed and lightly keep her laying, but as she progressed and got more aggressive, she started to kick the baby inadvertently while I was nursing, which caused the baby to cry, and I was unable to control my 20mo old due to her sheer strength. I felt myself get very angry while I was holding my 20mo down by holding her to the bed on her upper back and had a thought of wanting her to understand my boundary (or make her stop her behavior) by physical force/pain. I immediately felt guilty and lightened my grip and adjusted the situation by explaining that I was upset and angry and that we needed to take a break and move to the bigger bed (my bed) so I could nurse and lay with my 20mo as well. Once we got into my bed, I didn't have to redirect her to lay down as much and I just lightly would put my hand on her body and keep her still. I apologized to her in case I hurt her neck (she didn't react in pain to my aggression, but just to be sure) and praised her for remaining calm and being still and letting her body fall asleep.

Example: she’ll ask for help with her shoes, I’ll start to help then she’ll scream and decide to do it herself. Which is just so fine, whatever. And I might literally just exhale and say ‘ok good girl, go ahead’ and she’ll retort immediately ‘are you happy??’ 

I’m starting to worry that she thinks it’s her job to make me happy, and also I’m worried that she feels being happy is an important default. 

Sorry if I’m not explaining it right, hopefully you get what I mean.

Anyway, often I say ‘yes of course sweetheart, I’m just feeling under pressure…’ other times I say ‘well right now, I’m feeling a little frustrated and that’s ok darling!’ And sometimes I’ll even say ‘you tell me how you feel baby.’ 

We have a very close bond, I’m truly like her hero and she is mine. I want her to know all feelings are valid, and also that there’s no onus on her to make me happy.

414,AttachmentParenting,"How does anyone do it? Baby is 10 months and the only time we’ve been alone together is when we test drove a car last weekend for a few hours. Other than that baby is awake or sleeping upstairs. 

We could go have a date night (heck just lunch on our own even for an hour or so) but baby’s day and night sleep is all over the place currently, separation anxiety is through the roof and to be honest we’re both exhausted. 

He was happy the entire time we were out, but then screamed for hours and refused to sleep for nearly 7 hours and woke every hour that night until I gave up and slept on the floor holding his hand. A date doesn’t seem worth the next three days of even worse sleep. He used to be a great sleeper but since 7 months it’s got worse and worse every week. 

Baby wakes up for the day around 4-5am currently which I deal with Monday-Friday and my OH does the weekends. This means that by 8pm whoever did the early shift is exhausted. Day naps have fallen to 20-45 mins and the third nap has crept back in. Baby is in bed around 7.30pm. 

Whoever doesn’t do bedtime does clear up/starts dinner. But if my OH is in the office or working away/late then it’s on me. Then we eat dinner, fall asleep during a 30 min TV show and we’re in bed by 9/9.30pm at the latest. 

Baby then will get up at least once and if he does I’m wide awake and can’t get any sleep, be that baby waking at 11pm or 2am. I average 3 hours of sleep a day. I don’t have the energy to get dressed up and head out. My OH works long hours and studies so is equally exhausted.

But then he would sleep in his crib fine and just need contact naps. Okay fine. Then it turned into not being able to go back in crib after 3 am and resorting to cosleeping. Okay fine. Now he will only sleep in his crib for like 2 hours and will not go back in his crib after the first wake up. And it takes him literally hours to go in his crib, he keeps waking up when I lower him or when he’s laid down. Having to lower the crib made things even harder, it’s painful for me to lower him.

I've had these thoughts for a while and keep going in circles in my own head, so I'm finally reaching out so others with a similar parenting style for feedback. Maybe it will help me or maybe it will help someone in a similar situation.

It's at the point where we need to decide between a 3-4 year age gap between kids so it would be great to get some honest feedback from this community. I've strongly considered it, but I know I would regret having only one child. I thought I wanted a 2 year age gap, but when the time came I couldn't go through with it; I loved my baby and the little 3 person family we have. However, the time has come though to decide between a 3 year age gap or holding off to 4 years, and I'm still torn. When I think about a baby joining us, I can absolutely picture it and think it will work out (with a learning curve in the beginning). Our child has even expressed an interest in a sibling. However, when I think about all of the anticipation and work that needs to be done for our toddler to be ready for this (starting preschool so there's a little solo-baby-bonding time?, potty training readiness and potential regression?, separate bed sleeping?, falling asleep solo?), I worry it's not the right time. Is it ever though? Kids adapt right? Clearly, I think \*a lot\*. Could anyone with a similar situation or anxiety-level share their experience?

My baby seems to be very high needs/highly sensitive. I try so hard to be extremely hands-on, attentive, and engaging with him, but it’s never enough. He doesn’t independently play with anything for more than a moment or two, and he’s constantly whining/fussing/upset. He wants to me hold him constantly, he hates when I try to read to him, he isn’t interested in any single toy for more than a moment, and is pretty high energy while also being very clingy. 

This makes it extremely hard for me to get anything done without him being very upset, whining loudly for me to pick him up and do something with him. I can’t shower, I can’t make us meals, I can’t clean, do laundry, have a moment of peace, anything for more than a few moments. Forget holding him while I do things too, because he’s 35lbs and I’m constantly in pain from how much I hold him already. It’s been this way since he was about 6-7 months old.

On top of that, he only nurses to sleep, takes a looooong time to fall asleep, and will wake every 20-40mins unless I lay with him still or asleep the whole time. I have no time to breathe or take care of anything.

I feel absolutely terrible about it, but he’s the most calm and happy when watching Mrs Rachel. I feel so conflicted because I know it’s terrible for him, but it’s the only way I feel like I can do anything and it makes him so happy. 

I truly don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep using screen time, but what can I do when it’s so overwhelming? I have no village. It’s all on me. I take him to the library for story time and the park when it’s not too hot or rainy which he likes, but other than that??

435,AttachmentParenting,"I have an exuberant, headstrong, funny 2yo girl. She has the kind of personality that will bust through concrete to get her needs met (often at the expense of her 6 yo sister or my husband). I'm a very loving parent, but also very firm with boundaries around things that can hurt her or other people. One of our frequent points of friction is bedtime.

We have a pretty locked in evening routine - dinner, play, teeth, pyjamas and sleeping bag, stories, cuddles with her sister, light out, breastfeed, cuddle in her bed, goodnight. But she's clever - she knows that there's no more play after she brushes her teeth and gets her pyjamas on (she gets super hyperactive and way too overtired if I let her play after 6.30pm), so she stalls getting her pyjamas on. She refuses to pick a pair of pyjamas, or if she does, will ignore me when I ask her to help me put them on. Often, she will completely ignore me and jump and giggle on the bed. Most nights, the only way for me to get her attention is to tell her that if she doesn't want to co-operate with me doing the bedtime routine, then I will leave and not do the bedtime routine, but just turn off the light - it's her choice whether we do the bedtime routine or not. I give her to the count of 3 to come and get her pyjamas on, but when she ignores me, I tell her I will respect her choice and leave, turn off the light and shut the door. 

I then wait 5 seconds or so for the inevitable tantrum or scream, then return, saying something along the lines of ""oh! I thought you didn't want to do bedtime routine? Have you changed your mind?"" Note that it often takes 4 or 5 cycles of me leaving, turning off the light then coming back in to actually get her to co-operate and let me get her into her PJs and sleeping bag. 

I never order or shout (although I have, on occasion, used a firm, frustrated tone), I never force her to get dressed, I never threaten - I simply lay out the options I'm prepared to do - either get her dressed and have a lovely, snuggly bedtime, or I will leave now and turn off the light. But bedtime is becoming an ordeal, and it means I often miss out on saying goodnight to her big sister, as it often takes over an hour to get her ready for bed. Factoring in the time I have to sit outside her door so she knows I'm there while she is falling asleep, bedtime is taking over 2 hours - and given that I work 50-60h most weeks, and I'm the parent who gets up to her whenever she wakes during the night (which is... Often), it's leaving me burned out and making my older daughter miss out on the attention and affection she needs.

Part of me thinks I'm teaching her a useful coping strategy - showing it's ok to walk away from conflict when we are feeling frustrated, mummy might need some time to catch her breath but will never abandon her, and it's what I need to do so I have something left in the tank for my other child; but I worry I'm being manipulative and unfair by withdrawing myself from the room when she doesn't do what I ask.

During the day, when he’s home from daycare, do I just distract him so he doesn’t ask for “brrr” (his term for it LOL)? Do I stay out of the bedtime ritual entirely during this time? Am I scarring him for life by stopping so suddenly? I would have preferred to introduce the weaning more gradually but I asked the doc and there are no other options for me to take something else, it’s a pretty bad sinus infection and I feel so awful. At the same time, I’m looking forward to having my body back at night time. I think I will pump and dump during this time so we can resume day nursing if he wants. But I’m nervous for this afternoon when he requests his post daycare “brrr” and for bedtime/tonight with my husband. I appreciate your advice <3

Update: I googled and everything I read was in conflict with what this doctor told me, and it seemed safe to breastfeed while taking Azithromycin. I called the nurse line at the birth center where my son was born and they advised me that it was safe to continue nursing. They also sent a few resources they trust, “MothertoBaby” and lacted.org, in case I wanted to do some more reading on my own. I am glad I don’t have to cut him off cold turkey because I think it would have traumatized all of us!

439,AttachmentParenting,"Autistic 27 yo mom who suffered a heavily abusive home life & 2 kiddos - oldest is autistic and working on getting youngest evaluate, ages 7&6. 

Talking about my 6 year old today. I want to say that the way I word things is only so you understand what I’m dealing with and not because I see it as that specific way* (ex: saying she is working up doesn’t mean I think she is upset for no reason/ it’s just a shorter simpler way to put that she is frustrated/etc)
Anyways, my 6 year old is extremely high strung…constantly. 

I know this behavior can be normal for autistic children. But it is constantly like walking on eggshells with her. If things even slightly aren’t going how she needs or how she wanted she will get extremely hostile fast. I will admit I get anxious fast during these interactions with her. I have not always been the best with controlling my own emotions but I’ve been working really hard to be better and not yell or get worked up. But it still happens obviously. 

This morning we were getting ready for school and typically first thing in the morning is her “easiest” time of day where if something goes wrong she is a lot more chill about it, I’m assuming it’s bc she’s just woken up but not sure lol. But that was not the case this morning. 
She got this really cool shirt with a ghost on it and after getting her dressed she was happy about wearing her new shirt. But then she saw her sister get dressed and became very angry/upset.
She was upset all her dresses were dirty and she couldn’t wear one like sissy. Of course it was instant melt down for her, and sadly my patience was worn thin very fast bc I woke up not feeling very good. I started to get visibly worked up myself, and did ask her several times to calm down in a very frustrated tone and told her she was really upsetting me. 
This only triggered her more and I know that’s 100% on me. I started to count down from 10 to calm myself down , while she was still getting worked up, I finally calmed myself down and then asked her what I could do to help her feel better, I said “do you want a hug maybe? Squeeze your pillow? (Therapist suggested squeezing her pillow when she gets upset) do I need to leave you alone for a few minutes?” 

She chose the last option and me and her sister left the room, she came out a few minutes later and was fine and I apologized to her (and her to me) for getting so upset and we had a little hug and agreed we both handled that well after we came up with a solution, the rest of the morning went fine.

My question is does anyone else have a similar situation? Having a kiddo who is more quick to meltdowns when things don’t fall how they imagine and is prone to also having a hard time regulating your own (as in the parent) emotions? I grew up in a household that did not understand me or why I was the way I was. It really sucked and even tho I know being autistic makes this already hard enough for me, growing up in a house that was not kind and patient and understanding has made it even harder. I don’t know how to de-escalate myself and her better when these things start to unravel, does anyone have any tips for how I can better handle this in the future for myself* and for her* ???

441,AttachmentParenting,"My daughter, who recently turned 5, absolutely drains every little bit of patience out of me every night at bedtime. It’s been going on for so long now I don’t even remember when it all started. She screams and cries and wails every night when I try to leave her. Every night. I’ve tried everything. We have always had a routine, it’s evolved as she’s gotten older but the main things have remained - bath, book, bed. 

It’s taking over 2-3 hours every night to get her to finally settle and I’ve tried everything. The thing is even if I do stay with her to help ease her anxiety, she STILL kicks off at me and the end result is the same. I can’t win. And now she’s older she’s started saying a lot of negative self talk, regardless of if I stay or go. 

Tonight I absolutely lost it with her. She was screaming constantly for me to be with her yet when I was with her she was kicking and screaming at me to get out. This went on for what felt like forever, and I ended up flipping out at her, screaming at her. I feel absolutely terrible. And yet she’s still going now, whining and yelling. She won’t let me near her, which is totally understandable. She’s trashed her room in response. 

I needed to vent because I’m tired of the battle every night. I do my best to fill her cup, be patient, to be present. I just feel nothing helps. I’m not even sure if this is the right thread to post in, I’m just so lost with it all.

448,AttachmentParenting,"After lots of searching I finally found an AP/gentle parenting baby group. I drove to the next town and rocked up at the group. Baby in a good mood and he instantly heads on over to the soft play stuff. There are 6 mums and 9 babies. 

I put my stuff down and do the awkward hellos and names. I get to talking in the group whilst also going to interact with my baby and redirect as needed, everyone is doing that and we’re all sat on the floor chatting. 

Various babies go to their mum to BF and cuddle. Mine comes to check on me but is doing really well at finding things to play with and even brings me a toy he likes. I can see him getting hungry though. I step away and make a bottle before showing baby and he comes crawling over and starts to feed. 

That’s when two mums tell me I can’t do that in this group. I ask if today is a special BF support group as it said nothing about that on the page. They said no but AP can only be done with BF so I cannot be here. I tell them I will finish feeding my baby and then leave as I’ve never felt so unwelcome. I wish I had a witty comeback.

I feed baby as everyone talks amongst themselves. Pick up my stuff and walk out. I can hear the high school whispers as I leave. As soon as I’m in the car I put on a storybook CD and cry whilst listening to a story about a bumblebee.

For a while, he was fine starting the night in his bassinet. I would get anywhere from a 3-5 hour stretch to begin with.

At one point he was wide awake and didn’t seem tired at all so we did some more awake time on his play mat and once he started showing more tired cues, we started over with swaddling, rocking, nursing him to sleep.

He lasted maybe 30min. Other nights throughout this week he wakes right up after transferring him, even though he’s in a deep sleep and the transfer was done flawlessly.

It seems like he is also waking more frequently. 
Before it was about 1-3 times a night. Now it seems to be every hour-2 hours. 
He has also been extra fussy the past week, immediate cry when waking from naps, drooling a lot, and a TINY bit congested.
Is he now rejecting the bassinet? Does he just want to exclusively bed share?

Is it a growth spurt? Could the 4 month regression start early?

I came to this decision because I want to make sure I have equitable time and patience with each one, whether that is during the newborn stage or the toddler/school transitional phase. My first son being in school and transitioned into his own room (we bedshare, another factor) would make it much easier to give a newborn/toddler the attention they need.

I just know I would be too overwhelmed with having a toddler and a newborn, I would hate for that to translate into me compromising on my intended parenting choices. I have ADHD and am easily over stimulated, so I think this is the best way to go for our fam.

The last two weeks…. It’s every 2 hours on average. We’re at 6 wakeups a night, sometimes more. Last night was every 1-1.5 hours. When I feel him stirring, I try to pat his bum or give him back his paci if it fell out, shush him, etc… half the time it doesn’t work at all and the other half it only works until I stop and then he starts stirring/fussing again (even if I do it for 15-20 mins). If I just let him stir and fuss it always eventually progresses into crying and fully waking up. The only thing that’ll get him back to sleep is boob, he’ll fall asleep after eating for a few minutes.

462,AttachmentParenting,"My 4.5 month old son has been trying to move since he discovered that it was possible. 

He rolled early (not that it matters, but explaining for the sake of getting point across) after trying for weeks and being extremely frustrated. I asked around and have been told that it’s all normal and common. 
However-the moment the achieved this, literally the moment-he began to wail (not cry, but more like a yell cry with no tears) that he couldn’t get up and go anywhere. 

He has now been desperately trying to crawl ever since, and although it’s clear to me that he understands the concept and how to do it (I have helped lift him to check what his limbs do and he does understand hands, knees and using them to propel forward) he doesn’t have the muscle strength yet to achieve this feat. 

I of course have high hopes, for his sake, that he is able to get what he wants soon, though I honestly think that after he gets the hang of it that he will just yell that he can’t get up and walk around, lol. 

My battle, however, lies here: I don’t ever let him cry; in all other areas I always respond to his needs asap. If I notice when he’s on his tummy that his yells turn in to the start of a real cry, I intervene and give him all the cuddles and comfort in words. BUT-it is very clear to me that often when I respond this way, he about tries to leap out of my arms to get back on the floor for more practice. Very rarely does it seem he wants to be picked up, mostly it’s become apparent to me that his yells are simply frustration, or at the very most, if I’m right next to him, he will look up at me and yell as if mom might be able to magically gift him this talent. 
I listen to his yelling NON-STOP. From the time we wake up, until he goes down, 90% of awake time is spent on tummy time, because that’s what he wants to do. I want to be there for him through and through, but which is it? Let him stay frustrated and seemingly miserable? Or rescue him when that’s not what he wants? 

I’ve recently succumbed to a combo; mostly I let him yell and I verbally reassure him, and intervene-again if I suspect he will start actually crying. The rest of the time for my own sanity I TRY, usually unsuccessfully, to offer other activities, but they mostly result in him somehow getting back on his tummy to yell.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for a situation I find myself in. My 13 month old is a pretty sensitive little guy. He was born mid extended lockdown in our country so it was many months of life at home with just his parents. He now sees extended family semi regularly but probably only every few weeks. 

I’m struggling with the best way to support a fear that he has of my Dad. Nothing specific has happened and my Dad has never been alone with him. For some reason he just screams and cries as soon as he sees him. He has two Moms and is also somewhat wary of most men (I hear that’s common for babies, even those who have Dads!). But with my Dad it’s next level and he full on screams as soon as my Dad makes eye contact or comes near. 

My Dad never pushes it or gets annoyed etc. He usually backs off or walks away. Of course I also comfort my son and never push him to go to my Dad or minimise his feelings in any way. But I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for how best to support him? Is it best just to hold him and comfort him but keep talking to the adults so we don’t make a big deal or it? Is it best to ask my Dad just to not come near him? I know he wants to get to know his grandson and though he never pushes it is obviously painful not to be able to interact at all. 

Though I try not to get stressed and remember that my Dad is an adult and doesn’t need his feelings “managed”, nevertheless I do find I avoid seeing him due to the worry of how to best handle the crying.

I yelled at you yesterday. It was the first time, I'm sure it won't be the last, but I hope it is. Dad has Covid and can't go near you. Im exhausted and as I tried getting you ready for sleep you tried eating some lotion. I said ""ah-ah-ah"" a little too loud and pulled your little hand away. You cried and reached out for me. Climbed up me to hug. The person who is supposed to quell all your fears and hurt, scared you. I remember that feeling as a little girl. That tug back and forth in me. The person who's supposed to love me no matter what snapping at me. That fear that they don't love me and that reaching out to make sure they do. One thing I think I handled a little better. When I was little, I remember hearing, ""no I don't want to hug you right now. I love you, but I don't like you."" I remember exploding into, I hate you's that I didn't mean, slamming doors when I wanted someone to come after me, open the door, and hug me.

467,AttachmentParenting,"I started doing this a couple months ago without really thinking about it, but I'm not sure if it's AP friendly or yet another thing I need to unlearn from my own ducked up childhood.

My son is 13 months, and started really crawling around 11 months. Ever since then, when he's upset, cranky, tired, etc, I've been encouraging him to crawl to me when he wants me to hold him. Of course, if there's a real issue, like he's hurt, or if he's just really upset and everything's just so terrible that he can only cry, I'll go to him. But outside of that, I encourage him to come to me.

My reasoning is that I'm easily overstimulated, so this helps me differentiate between when he really wants me vs when he just wants to fuss for a bit. I've been burning out lately trying to get things done and if he can come to me when he needs me I get more done and then I'm less stressed and more emotionally available. Also, I want to teach him to speak up when he wants something, since assertiveness is a handy trait in general to have in life. I was taught as a kid to always put others first and I was afraid of needing things or of taking up any emotional space and I want him to be able to express himself. 

But then I started wondering if I'm just teaching him that I'm not gonna be there for him. I pay attention and if he's fussing I'll talk to him but I'm still wondering if I'm unintentionally messing him up.",teaching baby to come to me if he's crying,1661833287.0

474,AttachmentParenting,"So up until recently my little ones sleep had seemed to improve quite a bit. It used to be that she would fall asleep around 9/930, and then wake up usually sometime between 1 and 3 am, at which point we would bring her to bed, she would either cuddle or comfort nurse and then roll away from me and fall back to sleep. She usually woke up around 5/6 and did the same thing, then was up for the day at 730.

Lately however, she has been having a hard time falling back to sleep. She does the same thing where she will roll away from me after nursing briefly but then after a few minutes will sit straight back up and cry or crawl over to me (we have her crib attached to the bed) She doesn't want to cuddle, she only wants to nurse, but rarely stays on for long enough to get let down. This can go on for an hour or two. What's even worse is that if she has her pacifier in her hand she will just pop off the boob, put her pacifier in for a few seconds, and then go back to the boob. 

It's exhausting and I know that it's probably just a phase but I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through something like this? At first I thought it was a disruption in her sleep due to teething or learning to walk but this has been going on for some time now and I am just so tired of it.

How do we stop incorporating a bottle and milk to go to sleep?

From about 9 weeks to 5 months she was a phenomenal sleeper doing 12 hours/night with a little fussing the first hour or 2 and then would settle down without having to pick her up.  She wouldn’t even wake up at night I would basically pick her up and dream feed once in the middle of the night which she also slept through.  Then at 5 months it was like a switch went off and instead of the bit of fussing in the beginning it became crying every night almost exactly an hour after being put down.  Patting and comfort no longer worked I now have to pick her up (she immediately settles and goes back to sleep once picked up) and basically she wont sleep in her bed for more than like an hour at a time, sometimes 2.

484,AttachmentParenting,"I know it must be common for moms in my generation to be following much different methods and concepts than our parents’ generation did. And I’m guessing I’m not the only mom who cringes at their mom’s words and ideas or is often disagreeing with them. 

What I’m wondering is how often you’re stepping in to adjust or correct something they’re saying or doing with your kid? And I’m not talking about extreme things like spanking or things that are physically harmful. Things that they may not realize aren’t sending the right message or they don’t think matters. 

For example: today we were out and my daughter (18m) removed her headband. She typically leaves things in her hair but every so often she just doesn’t want to wear it. My mom sat down with her and had French fries and said she could have a French fry if she put her headband back on. “You have to put your headband on if you want to eat fries with me”…I guess the occurrence might seem insignificant to some, but it’s kind of a running theme of appearance centered messaging that irks me. Like it’s consistently about “pretty” or “sweet” and it’s usually just an age appropriate behavior my daughter is exhibiting, but I find that my mom’s generation doesn’t seem to have any concept of age appropriate toddler behavior and the expectations are too high and the things being corrected are trivial. 

There’s a part of me that wants to jump in every time and say “she doesnt need to wear a headband to eat a French fry” or tell her not to do that, or tell my daughter that whatever is happening is not true/right. But another part of me believes that it’s not worth the tension or struggle because it’s HER relationship with my daughter not mine. I’ve heard someone explain before that if they’re getting that messaging from someone else then it’s affecting that bond, not mine and that typically the effects of that messaging are mitigated at home. I don’t know how true that is, but I wanted to see how others felt because I’d love to be able to take that constant tension off my plate and worry about my words and actions, but I don’t know if I would be doing my daughter a disservice by not intervening.",At what point or how often are you intervening on the grandparents’ words/methods?,1661479028.0

So obviously for the first year we safely coslept following the usual rules, but let me get into the details. I was TERRIFIED of missing a SINGLE need of hers after having a traumatic hospital stay with severe jaundice. 5 days after giving birth, watching her sleeping alone and naked in an incubator for 3 days, isolated because of covid restrictions, I'm still getting over it.

Every night we breastfeed to sleep, I sing, rock and pat her. She loves it and falls asleep with so much comfort it makes me so happy. Her sleep cycle lasts between 45min-1.5hrs. She stirs and looks for me/boob which I give her while lying on my side so that I can be comfortable *enough* to sleep. Once she has boob she will drift off again. If I prolong offering the boob or rock and pat her to sleep without it she fusses and I don't want her to full on cry and wake up so I always give in. She will stir like this about 3-4 times on good nights, more on tough nights. Almost every time she stirs I sit up, push her over to the other side, and lie on my other side so that 1. I am not sleeping in the same position all night and 2. I alternate boobs. We sleep in one half of a queen size bed, my husband sleeps happily in his own space on his side.

It's been 18m now and I wake up tired every morning. I can't remember what its like to sleep well. Im typing this at 12am after my husband has moved to the couch for the night because of all the todsing and turning. She is taking up too much space in our bed now and wants to feel me and feed in her sleep but also kicks and fusses when she has no space to stretch. 

As of four nights ago I have her cot pushed up against the bed, the bars go down on one side so its like a side car situation. I get into the cot with her at bedtime, we read books until she's tired and I feed, rock and pat her to sleep. She stays in there for her sleep cycle between 45min-1.5hrs. She wakes up, knows I'm not there, sits straight up and fusses. I then bring her back into the bed where she stays for the rest of the night.

486,AttachmentParenting,"I’d love to hear from other parents about how responsive you are to your baby’s noises at night. Do you only respond when they cry? What about a whimper? A brief, momentary cry out? Does it depend on if they seem awake or asleep? And what information do you rely on to know what to do?

I fully understand that every child and caregiver are different, therefore the responses will be different. I’m searching for new ideas and perspectives! 

Background: 
I ask because I have previously responded to all cries, and only some noises in the night if the noises persisted after a few moments. My 3 month old is a very noisy sleeper, so I’m doing my best to determine when she needs my assistance and attention. 

I have suffered with some postpartum anxiety, which I’ve made huge strides on in the past month or so.

In the past few days, she’s started with a new cry sound that she previously hadn’t made. It’s a staccato “nyeh” “neh” “yeh” sort of cry (I don’t think she’s teething- bonus points if you know what this means!).  I decided to look up baby cry sounds and meanings, and discovered that a *different* sound that my baby often makes in the night may mean she is lonely. 

Reading this brought up lots of those old anxieties I’ve been working on, because this supposed lonely cry is something she will do a few times a night in just a brief moment or two. I had been assuming she was asleep and haven’t responded since she would immediately stop and seem asleep. Now I’m worried I ignored lots of lonely cries.

488,AttachmentParenting,"This sub has been super helpful for me in the past and now I am looking for some reassurance/advice about the dreaded 4 month sleep regression.

My baby daughter has gone from waking up once a night to every hour, resisting being put to sleep at night (sometimes for up to 2 hours), and fighting every nap like hell. I am a sleep-deprived mess. 

In the past, it was simple: rock her to sleep for naps and for the night, but now she will literally scream as soon as I start doing this. The nap/bedtime routine looks something like this: nappy change, sleep bag, feeding, story (at night but not during the day), “It’s sleepy time”, same lullaby, white noise and rocking to sleep. Except the last step is met with screams and resistance, so I normally cycle through the following steps for 30 minutes for naps/2 hours at night: I will rock her while walking, she’ll scream, I will try to give her a dummy while sitting down in a rocking chair (this used to work too), she’ll scream, I will lie down next to her in bed and cuddle with aim to transfer to own bed once asleep (this sometimes worked too), she’ll scream, I will offer her the breast again, she’ll suck for a few minutes then unlatch and scream, and I just cycle through, repeating from step 1 till one of them usually works in the end (normally, she will in the end comfort nurse to sleep after a few of these cycles). 

My question is: if this sleep regression is all about connecting her sleep cycles, and learning to resettle so she can put herself back to sleep after each sleep cycle, and I am not willing to sleep train as most people start doing about now, how do I deal with this? Do any babies who are rocked to sleep and not sleep trained learn to do this on their own? Because I am not willing to let her cry, but trying to settle her by patting and shushing her doesn’t work, it only agitates her more, and she cries if I try and let her fall asleep or resettle on her own, which I am not willing to do, so how have you guys who also don’t sleep train dealt with this? Did your babies eventually wake less in the night even without sleep training or without withholding rocking and nursing back to sleep? 

I kmow lots of well meaning people will recommend co sleeping but for reasons I don’t want to detail this would not be possible or safe for us. It’s the only aspect of AP we haven’t done and my baby has been very happy sleeping in our room in her own cot from the beginning. For medical reasons, we can’t co-sleep safely and also I am not sure it would make a difference, as I tried doing it with me being awake while baby sleeps next to me for naps and if anything she was more aggitated than when sleeping in her cot. 

I guess what I am asking is, how do we as AP parents approach sleep regressions, when many of us are not comfortable “teaching” our babies to self soothe back to sleep, and apparently that is the only way to get over this?

There have been a couple nights this summer when I was sick and my husband co-slept alone with our daughter. She obviously didn’t nurse during those nights. Things went relatively fine, but she did give him a run for his money wanting some milk… Other than those two nights, I’ve never spent the night away from her. I work from home during the day, so her access to milk isn’t super consistent, but she definitely nurses about 4x during the day. She starts daycare next week and will have even less access to the milk bar. But all in all, she still loves nursing and does it often when I’m around.

Here’s the rub:

I’d love to take a trip to see my BFF later this fall. She lives across the country - for many reasons I’d make the trip alone, and my husband would stay home with our daughter. I’d be gone about 4 days.

Clearly I wouldn’t be nursing my daughter at all during my time away. I know that she no longer depends on my breast milk for nutrition, so I’m not worried about that. I am, however, worried that she’ll really struggle without access to breastfeeding all of a sudden. And again, I don’t want this trip to provoke a full-on, cold Turkey weaning situation.

redirection during this curious

example: i have pesky vertical blinds that are so fun to play with & so easy to snap off the track. after the 3,682 time saying “no” and getting down on the floor with the toys my little will almost always choose the blinds. 

i write this post looking for advice and i’m admittedly seeking some feeling of “this is as normal as it can be right now”. 

boundaries are hard for me, heck, i’m still learning what MY boundaries are as an adult. i already worry that my seemingly excessive use of “no” is making some barrier between us. per the title, when it’s time to nap, sleep, wind down it is like a mini wrestling match and i wonder if my little bubba isn’t comfortable with me. the only thing that keeps me optimistic is that when they fall, are startled, worried I am the first person they come to or look for.","exploration, boundaries, and feeling safe.",1661314455.0

He goes to bed between 6-7. We still cosleep and nurse quite a bit. He’s never been a great sleeper but not awful. I would say pretty normal. Sometimes he wakes up 5-6 times, sometimes he wakes up once. I really feel like there is no rhyme or reason. Maybe I’m missing something. 

Anyway I try keeping him up later, I try getting him to bed earlier. Do you think it’s time for him to drop his nap? He used to sleep much better honestly. For a few months he would go down at 7 and I’d wake him at 6 or he’s sleep until 730. He would wake up 1-2 times.

She basically takes the stance of: “well, my kids turned out fine, and I’m only trying to help!”. 

So far, my parents have made multiple comments on:

- holding/rocking our 2 year old toddler to sleep

- limiting screen time (aka none yet aside from FaceTime calls). They basically said we are weird because we don’t have the tv on all day watching the news/shows. We usually watch tv on our phones at night, and don’t make a practice of having it on in front of the kids, as we just don’t have time and are playing instead. She actually started showing him cocomelon videos without us being aware when she was babysitting, and now he asks for them all the time. Her rationale is “he enjoys it”.

- the fact that our toddler is still rear facing, which is considered the safest option as per guidelines where we live, even though he can *technically* be forward facing

- not giving our toddler juice regularly 

- limiting our toddlers milk intake to 2ish cups per day

- limiting light/sound toys (aside from being annoying, our toddler will just press the button over and over, not really playing with it). Most toys they have bought him have lights and sounds even though we have asked to limit them. Not to say I’m not grateful, I do appreciate it, but they know how we feel.

- not letting our one month old cry to “strengthen his lungs”

2) he understands I teach students, so we talk how I will go to give a lecture and play with my students and he will play with kids and then I'll pick him up and we will have lunch (I teach morning classes at a University so I was thinking that we can start slow and he goes few hours every day)
3) When we get home he can tell his brother all that they did and teach him new games. (He has been saying that boy 2 will also go with him)

Bedtime though...it's often a 30-60min meltdown. I'm talking hyperventilating, fully body sweats freak out. It's been going on for about a month I think. Once she is down, she is good.

We've tried different things...earlier/later bedtime, top up bottle, breastfeeding to sleep, bath/no bath, different clothes, etc etc but nothing helps really. I've also tried cosleeping (which works for naps if I need her to take a longer one), but she just screams. And she can't stay in our bed as my husband isn't a safe cosleeper (heavy sleeper, moves a lot) and we don't have an alternative place for him to sleep.

Our current routine is:

- breastfeed
- change into pjs/sleep sack
- read a book (she is usually showing tired cues now)
- 1-3oz via bottle (we've tried no bottle, doesnt help and I'd rather get some more milk in her so her motn feed is later), sometimes she falls asleep on the bottle but wakes when we move her
- rock her to a drowsy state
- cue the melt down (if we skip all the above and go straight to rocking, she also melt downs. If we don't rock her she also melts down

The only way to reduce her angry is to hold her up right and vigorously bounce/dance to her playlist while we sing. On a good night, it's up and down crankies for 30min and then she gets dozy and we put her to bed.

She is on track in every other way; and no concerns whatsoever with autism. But she is a sensitive baby — very clingy to me in new environments, scared of blender / vacuum / some other random loud noises. 

That’s some background info, but specifically I’d love any tips or insights on reducing the amount of times she breastfeeds and how to gently redirect her behavior from aggressively pulling at my chest to feed in public.

. Part, though not all, of her issues with solids is that she breastfeeds so much she’s rarely really hungry for solids. She wakes up to feed about 3 times a night, sometimes more, though id say they aren’t all full feedings

I have tried to be more regimented and scheduled about her eating, but she gets very upset when I deny her the boob Redirecting her to solids when she asks to nurse—as I’ve been advised to do—just seems to make her more upset.

My hair is normally up in a bun or ponytail, but the ring of postpartum regrowth around my neck and ears remains in reach and he grabs it by the fistful and doesn’t let go.

We’ve tried to avoid making a big thing out of it, just a ‘let go please’ and prizing his hands open.

I’ve started putting him on the floor and turning/walking away immediately afterwards when I can (which makes him cry) but he most often pulls my hair when he’s tired or upset, so often I’m trying to get him to sleep or calm down and putting him down isn’t practical.

525,AttachmentParenting,"Idk if this goes against everything attachment parenting stands for or what but I need some advice. 

The past two weeks my 9 month old has been waking up every 2-3 hours at night. Previously he would sleep at least 8 hours straight. I assumed it was a regression and I know they advise against starting new habits to help your baby sleep during a regression but if he wakes up I've always given him a 2-3 oz bottle and he goes right back to sleep. With previous regressions that has helped him get back to sleep and within a couple weeks he's went back to sleeping through the night seamlessly. This time is different. He wakes up crying, I'll give him a few minutes to try and settle down but he doesn't. I'll hold him, rock him, give him a bottle and it seems like nothing settles him back down. The pediatrician said it's probably teething but Tylenol or Ibuprofen doesn't make a difference. 

During the day, I can't set him down without him letting out an ear piercing scream and he'll immediately start sobbing and crawling to me. I'm exhausted. I know its peak time for separation anxiety but between him not sleeping at night and having to be attached to me all day, I'm about at my breaking point. I love the bond we have but if I'm not within inches of him he's screaming and crying. He's always been a pretty clingy boy but I always thought once he started crawling he'd be more interested in exploring but that's not the case. I guess I just wish he was a little bit more independent sometimes, and I feel awful for saying that.

527,AttachmentParenting,"Please can someone help/offer advice on what to do with my 15 month old. 
From birth she has been a Velcro baby, we bed shared and contact napped for the first 4/5 months, before moving into the cosleeper. At 6 months, she was transferred  to her own room and cot as she would wake easily once I would go to bed and would be unsettled through the night as she would want to constantly be latched to the boob. This worked great, she would fall asleep in mine or my husband’s arms and we could transfer her no bother. 
After her first birthday this started to change and she wouldn’t let us transfer her at all. One day, I had norovirus, and my husband was away, and after trying for almost 90 mins I had to leave or was going to poop my pants. She cried whilst I was sorting myself out, and by the time I was out, she was asleep. Feeling drained and alone because I was still ill and my husband was away, I tried a loose form of controlled crying for the remaining days and by the end of the week she stopped grumbling before even leaving her room. All was working well.
The last few weeks something has changed and she is crying for longer periods (no more than 30 mins) at bed time. It’s taking her longer to settle and it’s making me feel so uncomfortable. I’ll cuddle and rock her and she will fight, sometimes throwing herself out of my arms, so I put her down into her bed and leave. If she will let me, I will stroke her hair and back, but sometimes I feel like I’m winding her up. I don’t want to co-sleep again, especially as I am pregnant with my second child; however, I can’t bear to hear her cry anymore. I don’t know what to do or how to help her, I feel like I’m doubting myself and if I go in I’m going to make things more difficult. I don’t think she will go to sleep if I’m in her room either, I’ve tried a few times just lying on her floor and she just starts playing in her cot, but she does stop crying. However, as soon as I leave she starts crying again. I want to help her gently and what we are doing at the moment doesn’t feel right at all. I want her to know that she is loved, safe and we will come back. Does anyone have any helpful advice?

My two year old twins are monsters. They scratch, kick, bite. They pour their cups out, they yell NO at me. They can also be very sweet and kiss each other’s booboos and give hugs. But, they FLIP THE FUCK OUT if I ask them to do something they don’t want to do. They snatch from each other and bite/hurt each other in retaliation. I can’t take my eyes off them. One of them bit another child at the zoo… to be fair, this kid came barreling in and shoved my kid out of the way, so it wasn’t unprovoked, but NOT OKAY TO BITE. The mom looked at me like I was a demon and my son was demon spawn. I’m at my wit’s end with how mean they can be. And the constant screaming and whining. I feel like I’m failing them.

When the behavior occurs, we ask if the other person is okay, say sorry (if they want to) and ask what we can do to fix it. But, now they’re refusing to do that.

He always needs a lot of preparation before we do anything. It's never been too much of an issue because I don't necessarily want him going up to strangers at the park etc. But lately, when we're at a grocery store or playground and a parent stops to looks at what he's doing or say hi yo him he'll yell back ""NO WATCHING ME, I DONT LIKE IT"" and I'm just mortified and have to take his hand and walk away/leave the store, otherwise he'll keep doing it. It really upsets him and sometimes he'll even cry if they don't look away. He has also started doing this with his grandparents who he sees weekly since he was born! It hurts them but they just ignore and look away when he does that and I'm not sure that'll help the situation?

I'm really hoping the yelling at adults is a phase but I don't know how to handle this situation gently and in a way that teaches him he can't do that to people (I always say he can say stop or he doesn't like that if someone is doing something that hurts him) but this isn't the case although it may make him feel uncomfortable...

530,AttachmentParenting,"My LO is 18 months and we’ve been bedsharing (he sleeps on our bed) since about 12 months. For the last 6 months I’ve been going to bed when he goes to bed which has varied from 7:30-9pm. I can’t yet foresee when the bedsharing is going to stop, but I also don’t think it’s sustainable for me to keep going to bed when he goes to bed because I’d love to unwind and watch a show or hang out with my husband after LO goes to bed. It’s also SO hard to get myself ready for bed when also getting my LO ready for bed since I like the house to be somewhat in order  (not crazy clean, just tidy so I don’t trip on stuff) and I also have a skincare routine and need to get in pajamas, prep the bedroom, things like that. My LO also has a huge bedtime routine (brushing teeth, overnight diaper, pajamas, sometimes bath) and it feels like it’s such a rush every night to get us both ready for bed and LO is usually melting down when I do my own personal bedtime routine. It’s exhausting and I’m just wondering if other bedsharers are doing the same thing or if there’s a better way? 

Btw, we don’t have our mattress on the floor because we live in an old house in the woods with spiders and things that crawl and I don’t feel comfortable about having a mattress on the floor. So, we’re on a bed frame that would terrible for LO to fall off of and that’s why I always stay with him in our bed.

Edit to add:
Wow! I am so honored to have so many responses and wonderful advice! Thank you all for taking the time to share what you do. What I’m gathering is: I should look into bed rails, maybe a side car toddler bed (never heard of that before!) and I should install a baby monitor in our bedroom (I only have a monitor in LOs bedroom, he sleeps on a twin mattress on the floor in his bedroom for daytime naps). My husband does help with bedtime routine most of the time, but sometimes he works late and can’t. But LO is always throwing a fit during bedtime routine, even when my husband is helping, so I am taking your guys’ advice that I should start bedtime earlier before LO is too tired. I usually try to start bedtime at 7/7:30, and we do dinner between 5:30-6:30p and that feels so early and also like such a rush, too. It’s all just so hard, everything about the afternoon/evening is hard with LO 😞 But I’ll start with looking into bed rails, side car and a monitor in our bedroom so maybe I can sneak away after putting LO to bed. I also like your ideas of watching a show with headphones in the bedroom with my husband. That could feel like we’re still winding down together without leaving LO alone in bed. And I also appreciated someone who said they have creepy crawlies too but still put their mattress on the floor and try not to think about it 😅 that’s definitely an option!

I guess I'm just looking for some advice/normalize my nights.
We bed share, partner is sleeping separately at the moment, since around 6 months of age night nursing is about every hour.

Today LO is 9 months, he has great naps during the day. He sleeps for about 1-2 hours straight from around 8 pm and then nurses every 40-60 minutes. No wake windows in the middle of the night, once in a while he'll need some bouncing but most nights just nurses A LOT.

We're waiting for an ENT appointment but at the moment all the health stuff are under control (allergies and potential asthma, reflux, mild eczema) and he seems comfortable. No issies with clothing or labels or what not, truly seems comfortable.

It's just that I am completely exhausted and touched out. I try to nap and go to be early but also need to unwind somtimes.

535,AttachmentParenting,"Let me start off by saying that I do not think my burn-out is a direct result of AP, nor do I think AP necessarily leads to burn-out, I am well aware this stems from my own expectations about motherhood, however today I feel just so low and exhausted.

My baby daughter is the light of my life and like 90% of the time I adore being her mum. The other 10%, though, I hate. I don’t know if it’s my expectations, or if I am doing something wrong, but every second my baby is awake, I am with her. She doesn’t always like being held in my arms or carried so we often lay down together on the floor or bed and I will be reading to her, singing, playing sensory games, talking to her, taking her for walks, the usual stuff. I do this exclusively. As in, I do 0 chores: we are fortunate to be able to afford a cleaner wbo does all that. I don’t cook: we meal prep on the weekends and my husband does the chunk of that. So I can focus 100% of my time on my baby, and I do. I am not exagerrating when I say I do nothing else for myself either: all my time is focused on my baby, and 90% of the time I am more fulfilled than ever. 

However, the past couple of weeks have been hell-ish. I am aware this is a fussy period as is, but I feel completely burnt out. My baby has been having issues with gas and general growth spurt fussiness for 2 weeks now, bedtime is a nightmare and involves hours of rocking, and she hasn’t really been napping during the day. This has left me exhausted to the point where today when I saw her start arching her back in pain, the first feeling I felt wasn’t sadness and that anguish I feel when I see her in pain, but irritation at the fact that I was about to have another difficult day with her. 

I feel like a failure and a monster: it’s only been 4 months, I do not have to maintain a house, and while I don’t have a village and I do all the parenting during the working week alone, I have paid help for chores and my husband helps when off work. Some women do it all alone and still don’t have these thoughts or feelings of exhaustion so early on. 

I know I put a lot of pressure on me, as I had a horrible childhood and want to be the best mum for my daughter, i.e. if she wants to she is always in my arms, I never leave her alone, I come up with new activities for us to do everyday, if she is awake I am either holding her or playing with her, but still many other women do this so why am I so exhausted? 

I just feel like a failure because my life is relatively easy compared to others’, and today I still felt resentful of my beloved baby for the fact that she would be difficult all day, even though I know it’s not her fault. 

My husband suggested taking her but I said no as I really struggle knowing she is in the house and I am not spending every waking minute entertaining her. The 10% I am not loving every minute of parenting her is horrible and exhausting.

 My boy has never been a great sleeper - he has hit all the regressions and when he grows, teeths, etc. it always reflects into his sleep.

537,AttachmentParenting,"Hey attached parents!

I’m torn on this so please, please help me out.

We found a part-time daycare for our 1 year son for 3 times a week 8:30am-3pm. It’ll allow both me and my wife to do some stuff while he’s there.

Pros:

- close to her work
- caring and attentive caregivers with a Montessori inspired approach (freedom, problem-solving, creativity)
- 2:1 ratio
- plenty of time outside
- he loves other kids so I imagine it’ll boost his socialization skills

Cons:

- VERY limited space. It’s a home daycare in NYC and it’s literally 1 tiny room with 6 infants/toddlers and 3 caregivers. Our son is very active and is about to start walking and we practice it a lot by walking him around our apt / playgrounds by holding his hands. He also likes to crawl. There’s absolutely no space to do that in the daycare.
- he’s a sensitive sleeper so he’ll have hard time adjusting, with some kids being loud literally next to him, on the other hand it might make him a better sleeper through shock therapy (???)
- 45 mins away from home (walk + subway)
- expensive: I calculated that hiring a good nanny for the same amount of hours will cost us 30% less

Another point in favor of a nanny is she’ll be able to 100% follow our instructions and develop him in a way we see fit (also Montessori-inspired), take him to music/literature/sports classes with other kids which will also socialize him.

551,AttachmentParenting,"I feel a bit burnt out. Processing some childhood trauma triggered by my sons age 17mo (similar age of a major trauma for me). Mostly though it's because my LO wants me all the time when I am in the room. My ""me time"" is always on the clock and I have to hide quietly in another room to have it, whereas dad can sit on the couch and do whatever he wants if I am in the room. Basically whenever I am around my son, I'm the only parent he is interested in, and yeah my partner takes advantage of this sometimes (he has promised to try to help more). I cant be anywhere in the house to sit and relax, unless it's hiding. My resentment and impatience has increased a lot, and I am at the point where I am struggling to regulate myself let alone my LO. I dont want to rupture our attachment with my impatience and snappiness, and basically what has almost become an avoidance of my son. I am just so tired. I want to enjoy my time with him more, but I constantly feel backed into a corner and that makes me grumpy and not wanting to spend time with him.

552,AttachmentParenting,"My daughter is 18m and I’m trying my hardest to follow an attachment/gentle parenting based approach. 99% of it doesn’t come naturally to me just based on what I’ve been exposed to both as an adult and growing up. My instinctual reactions and responses are typically not what I think is correct, so I’ve been working hard to retrain my brain to not follow what I know and instead to follow what I feel is right/best. Very few of my automatic instincts are “harmful”, they’re just not ideal and I’ve educated myself enough to know the error in the techniques and words that were used by my parents/friends/family. 

That being said, one of the things I’m drawing a big blank on recently is encouragement. I know the concept is that if you use “good job” or similar phrases too much it will create obedience not confidence. I just can’t seem to let go of the phrase. 

The thing that confuses me the most is that while my daughter is quite astute and seems to understand almost everything I say…I don’t think she would understand a lot of the examples I’ve read for “good job alternatives”. I don’t think “I can you’re working really hard at that” or “you’re a good example” or “that shows a lot of imagination” means anything to her at this time. And I can’t see how just saying words she doesn’t recognize in response to a positive action helps her at the moment? 

For example, when we’re finished with a diaper change I tape up her diaper and say “would you throw this in the trash can?” She does and I now say “thank you! That was so helpful.” But when this action was new most of those words didn’t mean anything to her so I’d say “good job” because she knew what it meant. Or if we go to the beach and we have shovels and buckets, and I show her how I scoop sand and put it in the bucket. Then she uses her shovel properly and scoops sand into her bucket….I say “good job” because I don’t feel like “wow you got that on the first try!” Or “you put sand in a bucket!” Has the same effect??

I know I’m likely just guilty of overthinking my words and I should just drop “good job” from my vocabulary but this seems like a tough age to be elaborating. And aren’t phrases like “you did it!” Or “wow!” Or “you did that all by yourself!” Creating the same obedience result if you’re just repeating the phrase when you can observe desirable or positive behavior? I think it’s her age…but I don’t feel like replacing good job with something she doesn’t comprehend or with another little phrase is effective for her?

The only thing I can say is that he generally naps well during the day, he has 2 naps totalling around 3 hours sleep. Only because I feed him to sleep and he stays latched on for ages and then sleeps on me for the remainder of the nap. Bedtime is painful, when I take him to bed at 7pm this almost always results in a false start around 30-45 mins later. NOTHING will get him to go back to sleep, not even the breast. He then uses 30 mins of sleep to coast by for the next 2 hours. The alternative is trying a later bedtime (7.30-8pm) which sometimes works but more often than not makes my son very hyper and overtired. Attempts to get him to sleep then result in screaming and inconsolable crying. On top of all of this, he of course wakes constantly through the night and will only go back to sleep by feeding.

My parents, while loving and supportive, have always been very strict, overbearing, and too much on the conservative side. I felt very misunderstood as a child and I felt that my emotional needs were often ignored or ridiculed. I was determined to make sure my children never felt this way.

Due to some long term issues with my sister, my parents currently have custody of my niece and nephew. They have been living with them for over a year now. There was domestic violence in the home and we suspect the kids now have some symptoms of PTSD and serious attachment issues. We also suspect my nephew is autistic. I have repeatedly stressed the importance of being sensitive to their needs to my parents and told them that the ways they were used to parenting were not going to work. I gave them books, websites, endless suggestions and techniques they can use (I'm working on getting my therapist license). But I don't see them making a lot of progress. I know the situation has been very stressful for them and they are already in their retirement years being forced into parenting all over again.

She sleeps most of the time she is over there so I never worry about her being in the way or adding more stress. I went back to pick her up around 3.

He’s never had a great latch, but it’s worse when he’s tired. I also feel like he’s eating so much all night that he barely wants food during the day, so he’s not making much progress on solids. I don’t want to push him to independent sleep before he’s ready. I’m a strong believer in supporting him to sleep. We already cosleep most of the night after the first couple wakeups and I’m happy to rock him or cuddle him or do whatever besides nursing to help him get to sleep. I just got him down for a nap where I didn’t nurse him, and he absolutely screamed for almost 45 minutes despite me holding him, rocking him, rubbing his back, etc. Am I pushing him into this too soon? I don’t want him to feel alone and unsupported. But I’m in pain, and we really want him to start eating more during the day.

581,AttachmentParenting,"Seeking advice, if maybe this has happened to any of you? 

LO has always slept in his room in his own bed. As he's gotten older usually after bedtime routine I would just lay down with him until he fell asleep, and if he happened to wake up in the night just go in there with him. He's never been a good sleeper, and I've always second guessed myself and wondered if I'm failing somehow. But in the end I didn't want to do sleep training and I felt like these years go by so fast, I don't mind having more baby cuddles if it makes him feel safe to sleep. 

But lately it's out of control and I don't know what to do. He won't sleep in his room. Or even in our bed. He insists on sleeping on the couch. 

So at first I was like, well, not that big of a deal, if he wants to watch a movie and sleep here for now and we'll move to bed later. But then he slept through the night for the first time in forever. So we allowed him to do it for another day, same result. And another day... and then somehow this bad habit has lasted a couple of weeks.

But the problem is he isn't sleeping well anymore, and still waking up a bunch now. And I know the screen is terrible for his sleep falling asleep to a movie. He's staying up too late and still getting up early. 

This is terrible for him and for me. I know that I need to find a way to fix this but I just feel so lost. I'm terrified because I have another baby due on October and I really thought he would be sleeping better independently by now.

601,AttachmentParenting,"Hello fellow attachment parents! My 18 month old boy recently decided he is no longer interested in nursing to sleep. We moved with that and are now reading a book, then singing and then rocking him to sleep. However, more recently he is squirming, crying or even screaming in our arms pointing at the crib. He wants to be put down and for us to sit next to the crib so he can fall asleep independently. The problem is, he can't. He just rolls around wildly or sits or stands up and eventually cries. I've been trying to add a crib sleep association to the in arms situation, a stuffed animal he cuddles in our arms. That one is now well established. Then I worked on rocking less and less, and I can now most times get him to sleep in my arms by just singing and shushing. I was hoping that would be enough to help him go to sleep by himself in his crib but it is not. Even if he is already very droopy eyed or even lightly sleeping in my arms when I put him in his crib he is instantly wide awake again, and wild with it. I'm not sure what to do next. I hate having to hold him whilst he so clearly wants to do it himself and fights to get away, but I can't see a clear next step in how to help him. I tried singing next to his bed for over 40 minutes and I got absolutely nowhere. I tried leaving the room but he just stands up and cries after a while, at which point I go back in because I am not okay with him crying alone. I wish he would just be happy being rocked to sleep because my husband and I love it, but he's clearly not. Has anyone been in this position? What did you do? How did it work out?

Edit to say that he is perfectly capable of putting himself back to sleep when he wakes up in the night. He pretty much never needs us at night anymore and hasn't for months. When he wakes he just babbles to himself, plays with his stuffed toys, maybe drinks from his waterbottle and zonks back out. So I'm not sure why it's so different. We've always gone to him at night the second he cries or sounds upset so it's not a learned response no one comes at night.

To get there, we practiced a bit of sleep training where I would pop in every 5-10min to assure our LO that we were still here. It took some time but I’d say it was a success. After all that effort, his sleep was constantly disrupted by developmental leaps, new teeth, get sick/Covid, moving or visiting family. Any progress we made seemed to come undone soon after. 

Since then, my wife has felt more and more uncomfortable with letting him cry without consoling him. I’m gaining that appreciation of consoling him too with what I’ve experienced and read.

Heya,

So my little one is 6 months now  he's always been a bad sleeper but recently since moving him to his own room its got worse. Originally he was sleeping downstairs in his bassinet and we were managing to get 6 hours uninterrupted . Since the heat and starting weaning he has been waking up ever hour however we had a few nights recently where he did midnight to five!!!
. We normally deal with these wake ups by feeding him back to sleep. However last night he just wanted cuddles.During the day we are also experimenting with following a schedule. However the schedule said wake him up after 1.15mins. naturally for his first morning nap he wants to sleep for two hours  not sure if we should go with what he wants? Sorry is this seems all muddled. I don't know if we should restrict daytime sleep more? He doesn't sleep more than three hours in total  now sometimes less if we go out. Today he probably slept 3.5 hours.   Also from 4am onwards he wakes up every hour by this point I am shattered and just stick a dummy in
I should add originally we feed him to sleep. He used to be able to self settle himself downstairs but feeding to sleep only way we could get him to sleep at all in the cot. Tonight managed to feed him a bit and hug him to sleep which was good!

609,AttachmentParenting,"We have a precocious, highly verbal, funny, creative 26 month old. She is also very VERY socially anxious. She hates our outdoor playgroup of 5-7 kids. She doesn’t like to go on the playground with others. One of her first phrases was “too many people” if that speaks to anything. I stay home with her. She absolutely loves her dad but even then it takes a lot of warming up for her to be ok with me going to the store or them going on a walk without me when he’s home. 

We found a fantastic sitter. She is in her early 20s, super energetic, sweet and creative with lots of toddler experience. My little girl has cried herself blue all three times we have tried it. We did do a meet and play hour two separate days before I tried to leave them alone. They have fun for the first half hour or so but then the sitter says as soon as anything happens that she would look to me for comfort - not being able to figure something out, tripping while running, or even playing make believe and pretending that one of her stuffed animals is sad - triggers her asking for me and then becoming inconsolable when I’m not there. I told her to call me if it lasts more then 15 minute. Not just fussing but really crying, and when I’ve come home she is truly hysterical. The sitter is calm and gentle with her but she just is screaming “where mommy where mommy!” 

I don’t want her to experience prolonged stress or fear. However, I NEED to be able to step away even for an hour.

610,AttachmentParenting,"This is in no way a bash on my husband, or those with anxieties, disabilities, or other social hindrances. 

Today, after purchasing cat food at the pet store, with dinner done, nothing to do and an hour until bed time, my toddler discovered he was tall enough to activate the automatic doors. Instead of running out to the sidewalk, he decided it was good fun to run between the in door and out door in a loop. The out door lead to an alcove with both the in door and the door to the street, they didn't open the other way so he could only move forward or leave. I found this to be a great moment of discovery for him, promoting proper ""traffic"" flow in a store, building his confidence in himself, and generally just a sweet moment of him having fun with the world. 

During this time, I had to several times tell his father to stop getting in his way, to stop attempting to get him to leave and causing a meltdown. He was dismissed to go to the car if he was feeling anxious over his son's behavior. To which he agreed, and little one was soon done after, maybe five minutes. 

In discussion later, he admitted he had no real reason to try to speed things up or get the toddler to stop, he simply felt anxious. Just as it was a teachable moment for my son, now it was a teachable moment for my life partner. Being parented by anxiety, causes anxiety. If he had parents who had allowed him to explore society in an appropriate and supportive way, then he would not feel the social anxiety he does now when doing nothing wrong (just a little abnormal, but that's a two year old for you!) If he wanted his son to ""inherit"" his anxiety, he could continue to block his way literally and figuratively toward growth. Or, he could work on healing himself, and get out of the toddlers and his own way by recognizing and in turn giving the grace and support for ""weird"" behaviour that he had never been shown.",Parent yourself first!,1659747262.0
611,AttachmentParenting,"Hi fellow parents, looking for advice for my 4mo (5mo next week!) LO who loves sleeping with mommy. Some background: I’ve tried to get him to sleep independently and it’s quite the struggle. Now that he’s rolling it’s especially difficult as he rolls and wakes himself up after about a minute, so we’ve done lots of contact napping and bed share at night as it’s what works best for us. My son will be starting daycare in a month, so he’ll be nearly 6months old. 

So onto the advice: I’ve read that babies adapt and often are completely capable of finding ways to sleep in different environments/with new caregivers. However looking for personal experiences from those who have bed shared and transitioned their kids to daycare?

Daycare has been closed for two weeks now over the summer. There’s one more week to go. When he goes to daycare, he drinks in the morning, when we get home, to go to sleep and then during the night if needed. But since we’ve been home together, he’s been asking to nurse non-stop. He’s teething and started biting again. He’s constantly fidgeting at my other breast while he’s nursing. And he’ll nurse for half a minute, go away and come back again seemingly a thousand times a day. 

I’m touched out. 

I started feeling angry tonight at bedtime when he bit me for the I-don’t-know-how-manieth time today and I knew that one more thing was going to be the last straw and I would actually lose my temper. 

So I closed up shop. I hid the boobies and told him no more boobies. He was so sad… he calmed down after a minute though and I held him while I cried and explaied why I was withholding the boobs from him. He just lay there, quietly. Then after a fifteen minutes, he started crying again. Again, he calmed down and I held him. 

Eventually he fell asleep crying a bit. I feel so guilty. I know he fell asleep, he’s okay and I didn’t scar him for life. But the idea that he doesn’t understand why suddenly he wasn’t allowed to nurse anymore breaks my heart. 

Because my IRL family and friends would only encourage me to take it a step further and do this every night so DS will finally sleep in his own crib, I’m coming over here to vent… I don’t want to hear it’s an accomplishment.

Hello! I don’t actually know how to cross post 🫢 so just copy and pasted my response to a question on 
r/parentingwithscience on arguments against CIO. The article at the bottom is long but full of good info. 

*ETA- I thought this may be a good resource here since 90% of posts are regarding sleep and/or skeptical and judge mental friends and family. 

For background, I am a behavior analyst and primarily work with autistic children and adolescents but am trained broadly in human behavior and have a masters in marriage and family therapy. So have experience and knowledge in both attachment and “extinction” (which is the principle behind sleep training). 

I’ll attach a great summary of the challenges with extinction in sleep training below. It is pretty balanced and looks at is as a treatment and considers things like parents beliefs and emotional response to being nonresponsive to crying etc. It basically says we don’t know enough about attachment and that true extinction is difficult on adults to do well without reinforcing “extinction bursts” where a behavior increases and can even change to a more extreme topography in response to not receiving the response it had gotten in the past. Then this increased intensity or topography becomes the go to behavior the next time the antecedent (being left alone to cry in this case) occurs. 
It concludes the CIO can’t be the only tool offered and it is not appropriate for every adult or child (example a baby that is already having maladaptive attachment will suffer further damage to attachment from pure CIO extinction.)

But outside of the specific paper, in the field of behavior analysis there is a huge movement away from extinction based behavior change as it is disrespectful to the person you are wielding it against and does not teach an appropriate alternative response. 

In using pure cio (kiss the baby and see them in the morning) you are assuming that the baby can teach themselves what to do, but what you are doing is literally teaching them, “you can cry all you want at night, but no one is going to come help you, so crying is a waste of energy.” 

In behavior analysis you would never treat “maladaptive behavior” (though an infant crying is arguably very adaptive…) purely with extinction, all behavior reduction needs to be front loaded with antecedent strategies and be responsive to the individual’s abilities and needs. An infant has few abilities and lots of needs. 

Returning to this specific article it concludes somewhat unsatisfactorily that there needs to be more studies and a better sleep training needs to be developed to offer families more responsive options and options that are easier for parents to implement.

 I whole heartedly agree and did not cio with my babe and saved sleep training for a time when she had better expressive and responsive language and could understand that we were outside her door and would return in X number of minutes and extended the time gradually. It’s not an “instant” fix, but in doing so we were able to actually teach replacement behaviors, ie “I won’t be able to come back in for ten minutes, but here’s your lovey and if you get lonely you can snuggle her and try singing X…” and practice those same skills during the, during play together and together in bed before leaving the room for the set time. to my mind this is how you teach a teeny brain to self soothe- by actually teaching them and not expecting the mushy brained infant “learn to self soothe” alone by themselves. Just my two cents.

We cosleep. I put her to bed in her crib around 8-8:30pm and we used to get up around 8am but with night wakings she compensates and will sleep in an extra hour. When I come to bed I bring her to the floor bed and nurse her and I usually fall asleep nursing her. She stays asleep when I transition her to the floor bed. 

She used to always sleep through the night. Cosleeping was working out great for us. I've tried nursing to sleep and everything and nursing just isn't working at this 3/4am wake up.

Now our landlord wants to sell so we have two months to find another rental.

I feel we should try Richmond out, but its making me very nervous for a few reasons.  Partially the move would be to support more time with DD, but equally this puts her in a difficult transition to move from our house to a new one in a new town with a new nanny...    Equally, if we just decide to wait and buy there we may not like it long term. 

We have a few considerations regarding DD: 

1)  This would mean finding a new nanny in richmond which we may struggle to do.  

2)  Our daughter will essentially have three carers in 3 months before settling in if we move.  On the positive we work from home most days so at least we are the constants, just not sure how long my work will be ""chill"" about my huge need for flexibility.

He’s never been into rocking and once he decided contact naps weren’t for him anymore (around 5.5 months) he prefers to have a wiggle/crawl/sit in bed before drifting off. Normally he goes to sleep in 5-15 mins of being put down after his routine. 

He sleeps through the night most of the time (after some random wake ups around 2-3am for a few hours just as he was learning to crawl recently) or goes back down after a quick feed. But he’s now waking at 4am when he used to wake around 5-6am. 

At 4am he wakes up balling his eyes out. I snuggle him but he pushes away, I try to feed but he’s not interested until later on (5/5.30am) and he can’t go back to sleep even though he’s yawning and rubbing eyes. He’s then miserable for the next few hours, doesn’t want to read or play or eat. He’ll then go down for a nap around 7am for 30-40 mins and after that he’s much happier and his normal cheerful self.

My LO is 7 months old. About a month ago, we had an unexpected hospital trip that ended up being two days straight awake and baby needing outpatient surgery. He is okay now, but ever since that trip, our sleep schedule has been so off. When we got home from the hospital, we managed to get to sleep at around 4-5 am (after Tylenol and cuddles to calm down). I didn’t bother waking him since the poor boy just had surgery and he woke up at 1 pm the next day. And he has been basically ever since that.

We still have a routine, in which he will get a bath, cuddles, and breastfeed to sleep. We bedshare so getting him to sleep and staying asleep isn’t too hard. Except, if I try too early, he ends up waking up a couple hours later like it’s a nap and it just makes the sleep schedule worse. Right now we’ve been going to bed at 11 pm - 2 am, and we wake up anywhere from noon - 2 pm. We’ve tried waking him up earlier- one day of bad sleep should fix it, right? Wrong. He sleeps worse. I don’t know how, but he’s even harder to get down at bed time and we end up going to bed as late as usual, just significantly more tired.

Thankfully my husband is home with us for the time being, but he plans to go back to work in a month or two.

634,AttachmentParenting,"In search of advice, maybe some of you experienced parents could help us :)

Our 11mo son is not napping well at daycare, he only goes there during mornings. He has had a tough month with roseola one week, an ear infection the next one and theething (the canines!) on top of it.

Usually he comes back super tired, we breastfeed to sleep and he has a long afternoon nap (1.5 to 2hrs).  He is a low sleep needs baby, a very active boy who likes to play, he doesn't STTN. We are responsive parents and so far it has worked for us, he is growing perfectly and has hit all his milestones like a champ.

As I said, daycare is not happy with him not napping ""as it should"", they rock him to sleep and transfer him to the sleeping area, sometimes this works, sometimes he only lasts 15 mins, other times he sleeps in the arms of one of the carers. They feel there is something wrong because he is not self soothing and putting himself to sleep as other kids. I understand he gets grumpy when tired but our paediatrician told us it is ok if he does not nap during mornings as long as he is sleeping in the afternoons.

Tomorrow, daycare wants to have a meeting with us about the ""sleeping issue"" of our son... this is driving me nuts, they made me feel like a bad mom with a problem child! I think sleep is developmental and cannot be controlled!! So... any advice on how could you approach this in an open and assertive way?

637,AttachmentParenting,"My 16 month old LOVES to climb on things. His toddler bed, dining chairs, stairs, playground equipment, us, etc. Tonight he figured out how to climb onto the couch. He knows how to get off the couch safely, but the problem is he likes to run across the couch and throw himself onto the cushions and tries to climb onto the back of the couch. The couch in question is in our partially finished basement, which had a poured concrete floor. We've put down interlocking foam tiles, but I'm so terrified that he's going to fall off while running or climb over the back of the couch, which would be a higher fall than just off the seat cushions. The couch also blocks off our home office (my husband works from home) from the baby-safe part of the room, so even if he fell off the back the couch unbothered, there's still a bunch of dangerous stuff back there.

I've been trying to teach him that couches are for sitting, not running, but I suspect we'll be working on that for a long while. It's not possible to move the couch elsewhere. He's never in the room unsupervised, but this evening all he wanted to do for the better part of an hour was climb onto the couch to run, despite many attempts to redirect his attention and holding him in my lap to model sitting.

Any advice for how I navigate this next stage of child-self-endangerment? It doesn't seem to be an issue of needing to climb, because he has lots of safe climbing options.

638,AttachmentParenting,"Hello!

My daughter is almost 15 months old and is becoming the sassiest little firecracker. The tantrums are very full on during the day, she refuses to get in the pram or car seat and goes stiff like a plank of wood, the screaming when she wants something, or sometimes just screaming because she doesn't even know what she wants! I think she is very frustrated that she isn't very good at walking yet and she really wants to talk. Anyway all of this in the day is bearable. 

The nights are honestly going to kill me. It has started taking 20-30 minutes for her to fall asleep at night. Usually on first or second wake up we just bring her into our bed (she's never slept through the whole night) so this is around midnight. Then it is taking 1.5-2h to get her back to sleep, she will finally sleep for 2h and we do the whole thing again over and over until we get up at 7am. During those awake periods at night she is absolutely nuts. Screaming as loud as she can, hitting us. I don't know what to do. She has had back to back to back to back sicknesses this winter like everyone in Australia but seems ok at the moment. Molars? We tried panadol before bed last night and still same same. She is on 1 nap which is about 1.5h but I'm thinking I might cap it back to 1h today, she's generally lower sleep needs.

639,AttachmentParenting,"I just want to start of by saying I believe in attachment parenting, it makes a lot of sense to me and I think in the long term it will result in more independence and secure sense of self. However, I struggled this past year. I felt like I didn't have the support I needed, and I am still feeling that way a lot of the time. My LO is 16 months old and still pretty clingy. I know it's developmentally normal and I'm still working out my own triggers and behaviors in response to that to unlearn some things from my childhood. However, I can tell my mom thinks I'm way too permissive and coddling to my daughter. She doesn't tell me directly, but she'll allude to it by saying, ""well I never did that with you three and it worked"". She claims we all STTN from the time she brought us home from the hospital.

Now my cousin just had a baby and I am not close with them, but they're BF and my mom keeps telling them to contact me if any questions because no one else in my family has BF. That said, they were stuck in the hospital for a week because their baby had a lip tie and they had to have surgery then healing. Now my mom said they're home and struggling with being able to put the baby down. I said to her, ""that sounds pretty normal to me"" and she's going on and on to me about self-soothing and that not letting them cry at that age is just creating a spoiled baby... She's a week old!! I'm pretty dumbfounded that she would think this way, but it also makes sense based on the other things she's told me. I want to share with her my understanding of attachment theory, but every time I bring it up I can tell she thinks it's nonsense. The main reason I don't get into it with her is that I'm afraid she's going to bring up my daughter's whiney and clinginess and poor sleep as an example of how attachment parenting doesn't ""work"" but it's too hard to explain to her the long term benefits.

641,AttachmentParenting,"My son is about to be 20 months old, we have coslept basically since the beginning and he breastfeeds on demand all day and thru the night. Lately he’s been teething so there has been a LOT of wake ups just to nurse, so there is that issue, but even when he isn’t teething he wakes up pretty often (to nurse back down).

I know that is normal for a lot of babies/toddlers, but the reason I ask is he is also pretty easily *woken* up. My husband used to sleep with us but he moves around a lot at night and snores sometimes which always woke up my son, so he’s been in the guest room for a majority of the time. Now *I* usually don’t move hardly at all which is why it works, or at least I thought it did, but there have been a few nights recently where he is going on a 4-6 hour stretch, then I wake up and adjust slightly, and he’s up. Then every 1-2 hours after that...many times after that initial wake up, if I move it wakes him up. 

Basically I am noticing that I wake him up a lot, and I am thinking I do this more often than I would have previously thought. 

So I was thinking of moving his bed into our room to try it out, we have the white noise and it should be far enough away that he wouldn’t be able to hear the rustling of the sheets but idk...honestly I think I am afraid of change lol. Did any of you have this issue? How did you go about it?

I try to tell him that he cannot have certain thing (for example go to the playground) now, but we can go tomorrow after he sleeps. He continues to cry for about 20 minutes. The problem is, I cannot help but get really annoyed because I feel helpless - cannot touch him, cannot reason with him. So what I do is to go to another room but that results in more crying. Occasionally I raise my voice and tell him to calm down (I know this isn’t how it’s supposed to be), but that also doesn’t help and results in more crying.

645,AttachmentParenting,"For background, our baby has never been a great sleeper. He's pretty much only slept in three-hour stretches his entire life, which I've come to accept. As long as he doesn't wake up a bunch in the 4 am-7 am stretch, I can generally manage okay. This last month or so seems to have disrupted all of that, however. We've had some big changes and adjustments here lately (started daycare 3x/week, first cold, teething, heat wave, and learning to crawl) , and I think they're contributing to some really crappy sleep. We've had a LOT of false starts lately (something we had early on) and an inability to fall back asleep at night. Last night, he woke up at 9:30 and wouldn't transfer to the crib after nursing despite our best efforts. We ended up trying to get him back down until 2 am when I finally had him sleep in bed with me. Co-sleeping got him back to sleep fairly quickly, but I find it so uncomfortable, it really isn't my preference. Some nights we're back to hourly wakings, too.

I'm not sure if there is some way we can tweak his schedule to help improve things, or if this is something we need to ride out. He sleeps in a crib in our room and has been going down around 7 these last few weeks.  Part of me feels like he does better with a later bedtime, closer to 8, but I just don't see how we can keep him up that long. With daycare, he's no longer able to do his two 1-hour contact naps and sometimes only sleeps for 30-40 minutes total for the whole day (The other day we picked him up and he'd been awake since 1 pm and didn't go down for bed until 7). He normally does 3-4 hour wake windows but again, these get crazy stretched out on daycare days!

I'd love to hear some ways I can better support babe getting decent sleep again. Already checked some of the wonderful resources available online, like heysleepybaby (love her). Thanks in advance!

ETA: Baby is combo fed throughout the day with some solids at lunch and dinner time. Mostly nurses throughout the night to get back to sleep, though this stupid cold seems to have changed that somewhat, even though the congestion has dissipated. Occasionally, when he wakes up, I'll bring him to bed to nurse and he starts crying and turning away :(

His bedtime routine usually consists of going into our room, turning on white noise, feeding, story, changing into PJs, and then swaying/rocking to sleep. It might be worth mentioning that he's been especially bouncy at bed time and it takes a few minutes longer than it used to to get him to fall asleep.

653,AttachmentParenting,"So my baby (8months) fell out of bed at 4am this morning and his screaming woke me up. I feel absolutely horrible, like a terrible mother for letting it happen.

For context, my little boy is generally wonderful, he's really friendly, has a lovely temperament, rarely cries etc. He's very attached to me (I've been told he's too attached, which is a load of crap) and he gets 10/10 for everything except sleeping.

When he was 3.5 months old, he started his first sleep regression and he never came out of it. He will wake anywhere from 4 times to 18 times a night. I eventually caved after he turned 6 months old and started cosleeping because there was no end in sight and I needed to sleep somehow. We've worked out that if he naps well during the day, he'll sleep a bit better on a night but still wakes up a lot and feeds to sleep every time he wakes up. Also, my partner is a nurse and works shifts, so when he's on nights I stay at my Mum's house so I can sleep in the morning to catch up on lost sleep, but it's a single bed there so I can't cosleep. I'm also pumping for hours after my baby goes to sleep, trying to increase my supply and build a freezer stash for when I go back to work in a couple of months.

So the night before last, my little boy had a particularly bad night and all the different factors meant that I managed a grand total of two hours sleep throughout the night. I was running on fumes and my Mum felt bad, so she offered me her bed to cosleep last night so I could hopefully get a bit more sleep than the night before. She did offer to take him for the night but I didn't have enough milk expressed so I'd still be up to feed him throughout the night, it made more sense for me to just have him in bed with me.

So I slept well, and I think I was in a much deeper sleep than usual because I'd rolled on to my back a bit further away from baby. Then he's rolled away and fallen out of bed on to hard flooring and woke me up screaming. I felt so bad, I can't believe I've let this happen to him. I get that accidents happen but I was right there. I already feel guilty for cosleeping because it's not something I ever wanted to do, and as a midwife, I actively advised people against it at work because of the SIDS risk. Now I feel even worse because this would never have happened if he was in a cot. I've not gone back to sleep since it happened because I'm so worried he'll do it again.

I'm just at the end of my reserves now and feel like I can't take much more. I don't know what I'm hoping to achieve by posting this, but it feels nice to get it out at least.

654,AttachmentParenting,"TL;DR at the end! 

Hi everyone, I just wanted to ask what you all thought about leaving baby with other people. I had a lot of neglect in my childhood and I've been very into attachment parenting since my son was born 6 months ago.

I am very very rarely without him. We cosleep and he is with me every day of the week. I spend very little time outside of the same room. I don't mind this, I love our close bond. He's my best mate and we have such a lovely time.

However, I'm starting to miss things I did before, like going out for a night out for example. My son sees my sister once a week and knows her well. Would it be damaging to his attachment to me if I were to leave him with my sister at my house for a few hours?

I guess I don't really understand how it works and how the attachment is broadened, at what point more and more things like staying at someone else's house becomes safe to them. I find it really hard to trust people with him because of my history and this is another thing I'm finding difficult. 

TL;DR: At 6mo would it be damaging to try to spend some time away from my son?

Edit: thank you so so much for all of this advice. It has helped my anxiety no end, and it's nice to get advice from others parenting in the same style. I think so far I've only had input from the family that trauma'd me.

Anyway, am i doing it wrong by respecting the asked for space? I want to trust him to trust his body and emotions and only get the support that he needs, whether it be space or a cuddle - but is that an unfair expectation at his age?

Societal pressures got to me and I had a phone consultation with a sleep nanny who had amazing reviews.

She said my baby is ruling the house and he’s a “little tinker” and I “need to start showing him who is boss”. I feel so ashamed. She suggested a completely parent-led routine but it feels so unnatural to me. She also wants me to completely night wean him and not “let him get what he wants”. Feel really down and confused.

661,AttachmentParenting,,Need advice on managing my relationship with my almost 10 year old daughter.,1659152711.0
662,AttachmentParenting,"Okay, I’m a single mom of a 3.5 year old energy ball, and a little 12-week old babby!

My eldest son by the age of ONE had dropped down to a single 30minute nap every day. I had just moved to a new country (NZ) and was alone (took 8-months for my husband’s visa to come through), working from home and the pandemic hit. It broke me.

I took him to specialists and child wellness nurses and everyone basically said: he’s fine and happy and growing and developing normally- he just doesn’t need much sleep in the day.

So, here I am, now with my second baby, my husband and I have separated, and I’m on my own with the kids and want to try to set an excellent routine to try try TRY and have a baby that will have decent naps so I can have a break and get stuff done. 

For some reason naps confuse me and I feel overwhelmed at times trying to figure it out.

Generally I settle him down for a nap after he’s been awake for 1 to 1.5hours. But I’ve also heard that wake windows aren’t really a thing. I try putting him to nap in his actual bed (a moses basket next to my floor bed) with darkened room. Our room is never pitch black because even during the night we have a gentle warm nightlight and he sleeps fine during the night. 

But I read that they should be in pure blackness, but won’t that confuse them into thinking it’s night time?

I change his nappy, put him in his ‘love to dream arms up swaddle’, sing him one of two lullabies, give him booby, and put him down (either awake or asleep whatever happens naturally) in a very dimmed room, good temperature, with a rain white noise machine. 

But some days he will wake up at 30mins on the dot. Every time. When he does this all day it’s exhausting, mentally and physically. An hour of cuddles, play, tummy time or bouncinette while I try to clean or prep dinner, then routine for 20 mins, then half hour sleep and repeat. 

My older son goes to childcare M-F, and on those days the baby has to come in the car and often falls asleep in his car seat. Sometimes for 15 mins and sometimes his usual half hour. 

He will maybe every second day have an hour nap once in there.

I dunno guys, I’m not sure what to do and how to give him the best settings for developing a nap schedule - if that’s even possible. 

It gets tricky if he’s waking from a nap half an hour before my eldest has to go to bed, managing them both at that time is intense. 

And what if I want to go out during the day, is him just sleeping whenever wherever going to affect his long term ability to nap? Should I wait for sleepy cues or follow a timer?

Is it possible? TIA x",Please help me get my head around naps!!! Like what even are they?!,1659151725.0
663,AttachmentParenting,"Gonna be a long one but I appreciate any insight!

My four year old daughter ticks every box for a highly sensitive child. She is very bright, quite introverted, picks up on tiny details, has never enjoyed loud noises or strong smells etc. She has always needed a lot of help to regulate emotions (though I'm not sure I do a very good job at this and my husband certainly doesn't). I try my best every day to parent her gently but I do struggle with triggers I guess from my own childhood with her tantrums and I sometimes feel very lost.

Over the last few months, it has become a struggle to get her out of the house in the morning. She will be absolutely fine and then as we are putting shoes on, she falls to pieces, kicking and screaming. There's no pattern to it and it doesn't matter where we are going. She attends daycare twice a week but we aren't under time pressure to get there and we have a very leisurely morning beforehand. Even taking her to the playground or an activity she has chosen results in a meltdown. It often throws off most of the morning.

 For instance yesterday we were going to a small market to buy stuff for dinner before going to a trampoline park, which she loves. She lost it before we left, then once we got to the market we stopped at the cafe for banana bread and a coffee for morning tea and she kept trying to climb on the counter as I was ordering, after the second time telling her to stop, I snapped and raised my voice and said ""you need to stop climbing now!"" I'm sure I shocked and embarrassed her but her response was really next level. She was practically frothing at the mouth, her eyes get like a glaze and she's basically possessed by her tantrum. The staff tried to help me as I have a one year old too but in the end I was basically crying myself and had to carry them both to the car without managing the shopping. She screamed that she would open the car door and run in to the road, then proceeded to kick the back of my seat screaming she wanted to go back to the market. I said we'd try again later when we all felt calmer.

She is a very sweet girl and I love her company but I often feel on a knife's edge with her. She often strikes me as highly anxious, which I struggle with as that's not really something my husband or I have experience with. Today we got to ballet and she said she didn't want to go in. ""I JUST DONT WANT TO!"" so we left. Later she told me its because she misses me when she's there. It's a 45 minute lesson and she's been going for months, usually very happy to go in. I feel sad because it sometimes feels that she's never genuinely happy. She struggles a bit with friendships at her new daycare and said to me that ""I wish I could be funny like the other kids but I just have to pretend to laugh."" (I think by funny she meant ""have fun"") which just broke my heart. With her best friend who is my best friend's son, her joyfulness is palpable, because she is so comfortable in his presence and I just wish that she could feel this way more often than the hour or two she sees him every week.

Most of my friends with kids the same age are less attachment focused and would think I have made her like this by being too soft or they'd offer advice like ""just ignore the tantrums"" so it's not something I feel I can ask them if it's normal for their kids to behave in the same way.

I have a really hard time with excessive noise and getting angry when I am overstimulated. We have a 3 week old daughter and every time she cries it is an absolute nightmare for me. I refuse to let her cry alone or put her down when she's upset. But that shrill screaming she does wrecks my brain. My husband can handle it better than I can but I feel guilty because he's already doing so much (currently he is the only one working) and I hate waking him up to take care of her when his shifts start early.

665,AttachmentParenting,"tl;dr This week my 5 mo has seemingly suddenly forgotten how to fall asleep at night. Every night this week has involved lots of tears and frequent wakeups with more crying, and I don't know what to do! I want her to be able to fall asleep without getting so distressed, and I want my quality of sleep back too. Has anybody else experienced this, and if so what did you do??

Background: when she was a newborn, she hated being on her back, and every bedtime was a struggle. We did all naps in the sling but when we put her down for bedtime she would cry and cry. Even if I fed her or rocked her to sleep, when I would put her down she'd wake up within 5 minutes crying. Feeding in bed was also never an option because she would  spit it all up, requiring changing her clothes, mine, and the sheets---very much defeating the purpose. So we spent every night alternating between rocking her until calm and putting her in the cot until she finally fell asleep.

At around 10 weeks, she finally got accustomed to sleeping on her back at night and turned into one of those magic babies who can fall asleep on their own. Since then, she's slept like a dream. The 4 month regression did rear it's head a few weeks ago (going from 1 wakeup per night to 3-4 for a few days, and since then 2 wakeups per night) but overall wasn't so bad, I think because she could already fall asleep independently. We still did all naps in the sling for a long time but I started doing some of them in the cot a couple weeks ago and that was going great too.

But then, this week.... It's like she's forgotten how to fall asleep entirely. First she started refusing naps in the cot, and now bedtime too. I put her in her cot nice and calm and sleepy from eating, and she starts wriggling around and rolling and getting more and more hyper until she starts crying. She'll be giving obvious sleepy cues like yawning and rubbing her eyes, so she's clearly tired, but just cannot fall asleep. So now I'm back to alternately rocking her until she's calm and putting her down until eventually asleep, but it is so distressing to her that she wakes up every hour afterwards crying again. As when she was younger, even if she falls asleep eating, when I move her she wakes up. So I am really at a loss for how to help her fall asleep without an hour of crying first and many subsequent wakeups involving more crying 😞 

She just started rolling and I think that might be contributing to this but I don't know how to improve the situation... is this just a phase and she'll remember again in a week? Or are there other strategies I can try to help her fall asleep?

666,AttachmentParenting,"LO is almost 5 mo. He was not a good sleeper before the 4 mo sleep regression and yet still managed to ""regress"". It's been 2-3 weeks since he's been waking up every hr (with an exception to one part of the night where he wakes up after 2 hrs). We've been working on building a good bedtime routine in hopes that would help him to sleep longer but nothing has improved. 

At this point, I feel like I have two options: 
1. Suck it up with hourly wakings and pray that he can figure it out before I go crazy (while maintaining the established bedtime routine)
2. Sleep train (CIO, Ferber, etc)

Are there any other options I'm not considering? For people who didn't sleep train, did they have decent  sleepers to start with or are they all saints? 

I wanted to ask this group because I thought y'all might have different ideas/perspectives I haven't thought of. Thanks!

Edit: I'm okay with 1-2 waking at night for feeding. Heck, I'll take 3 wakings any day at this point. My goal isn't necessarily to eliminate all night wakings. I do have to go back to work in 3 months so hourly waking isn't sustainable in the long term (in addition to keeping my sanity a little).",Is sleep train the only answer?,1659122146.0
667,AttachmentParenting,"UPDATE: I was able to turn his crib into a sidecar yesterday and last night was great! Usually when he naps in my bed he wakes up and looks at me, then goes right back to sleep and that’s what he seemed to do when he stirred last night, only waking a couple times to eat. I was even able to move him over just now for a nap without him fully waking so I can take a nap too while we are both in our own spaces. So it seems like it was worth it even if it’s only for a few months. 

Considering using the sidecar method to attach my LO’s crib to my bed, but not sure if it’s worth it at 5 months or if it would be too short lived to be worth it. 

He started in a combination of using the bassinet next to the bed and bed sharing and I was able to get him to sleep solely in the bassinet around 2.5 months. Around 3.5 months, he hit the 4 month regression and we coslept a lot to make it through, ending with him sleeping in his crib alone across the room. 

Now at 5 months, the last week and a half have been terrible with wake ups and him wanting to sleep with me again, so I’m considering attaching his crib so he can have his own space but be close again. 

Even when we did cosleep, I got so nervous that something would happen and it really hurt my sleep. Now the 1-2 hour wake ups are ruining my sleep and I feel like it would be better to have him close but not in the bed with me.

I’m just not sure it’s worth it when he’s so close to crawling. For parents who sidecar cribs, when did you transition LO to their own bed?

668,AttachmentParenting,"I love bedsharing so much and am so against CIO but the last couple weeks my 7 month old wakes minimum 4 times a night and maximum over 12 times per night and the problem is she doesn’t go back to sleep easily anymore. I can feed her, nothing. I rock her for sometimes up to 2 hours to get her to sleep only for her to wake up the instant I lay down with her. Her naps are now going downhill too. She’s going from 3 to 2 and they are only 30 min to an hour each. I have to use those nap times to do school work. I’m a single mom with no breaks. There is no one else to take her so I can sleep or even go cry. I try to hold back my feelings but I’m starting to feel so miserable and even angry from the sleep deprivation. I have to force a smile to her in the morning as she hitting me and pulling my hair for me to get up. I don’t want her to CIO but I’m worried this is affecting our bonding because I feel so irritated with her all the time. I’m getting to the point where I’m counting down the hours until bedtime.

Edit: thank you everyone! I really needed the reassurance and the tips that you gave me. I’m planning on following her cues and most likely dropping a nap and having a later bedtime. I’ll give an update how it works out. I never want to resort to CIO. I just felt so hopeless when writing this. I don’t think I could even stomach it if I tried honestly. A particular thank you to u/artemis286 for her detailed response. I really needed to hear that and I appreciated your response so much. If I could give you an award I would. ❤️

Update: I followed her cues today. She had a nap around usual time in the morning for about an hour and 15 minutes and then one at 3pm for about 30 minutes. She skipped her last nap and finally got tired at 8pm. Took her all of 5 minutes to go to sleep. Let’s see how the night goes. 🤞🏻

So she slept great until her first wake up at 1am then again at 4 and from 4 to almost 6 she’s woken up multiple times. This seems to be the pattern.

What age is best to move her to a floor bed? I know it's technically possible from birth, but is it better to wait until she can crawl? Walk?

What type of mattress is safest? Is memory foam too soft? Will a firmer mattress be too firm for when she's older? Brand recommendations welcome!

I have a habit of meeting a nice genuine man, getting to the third date and then feeling claustrophobic at the idea of a relationship and then breaking things off. On the one occasion I went further than three dates I just couldn't open up at all and I felt almost like a robot, incapable of feeling any positive emotions. The reality of a relationship makes me feel as if I am trapped. I don't like the idea of having to meet up with a guy atleast once a week to keep the relationship going, it makes me feel drained of energy just thinking about it. The idea of meeting someone and falling in love sounds amazing, however the reality of consistently meeting up with the man I'm with on top of work or other commitments just feels draining and I become uninterested. 

Once I break things off with a man, I feel temporary relief followed by a feeling of sadness that I am no longer with that person and I wonder what could have been. I am still trying to understand why I feel the way I feel and how I can overcome this to have a loving relationship. I have never felt romantic love and it is as if I am closed off to feeling it. 

Childhood summary:
My dad lived with me my whole childhood and was never away because of work but was always distant, emotionally unavailable and uninterested in me. Even having a conversation with him was something I realised I avoided because he was always negative, aggressive etc. It might sound odd but I only consciously realised this when I reached adulthood. He only ever talked to me when he had to and that was usually to tell me  off. I very much believe that he would have been happier if he hadn't had children. My mum on the other hand was very protective, overly involved and anxious. My parents never had any arguments and I always knew they would be together forever, however they never even showed any affection with each other as a couple such as hugs, holding hands etc. 

As I got into early adulthood, I realised I naturally tried to avoid men and viewed men as aggressive and not as nice as women. This view has changed since as I have encountered nice men in life and I have been understanding my preconceived views of the world based on my childhood and I have been trying to challenge them. I still however find that I am incapable of feeling love and I am honestly not sure I could ever have a relationship, let alone a long term relationship. 

I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas on what is best to do. I have tried counselling but it was not helpful at all. Even just an opinion on the description of my childhood above and how this has played into my avoidant attachment style would be great.

Any perspective or your own experiences would be great to hear. I actually can't find out a lot of information on the internet.

My 3.5 year old has been potty trained for a bit over a year now, but I’ve been dragging my feet on nighttime learning because we bedshare. My thoughts about how to approach this include putting a fleece blanket over the bottom sheet (we do have a mattress protector), and replacing it with another when she has an accident so I don’t have to strip the bed at night. I’ve also read the suggestion to wake the child in the night to use the bathroom. And, of course, limit liquids some time before bedtime. Do any of you have other tips and/or reassuring stories? She learned to use the toilet very quickly, so I’m hopeful this process won’t take too long, but I know I have to be patient if it does. I can add that she wakes up dry 90% of the time.

I was considering sleep training but I just couldn’t do it, we’ve had many issues that prevented me from trying any harsh methods. So I kept nursing to sleep up until 9 months and it is still going. Only that, it isn’t working like it used to 🥺 I try to follow a routine with bedtime music before we go to bed and even follow wake windows.
In general, Baby acts like he’s on a strike, can only hear him feeding for a bit longer when he’s sleepy. But getting him to nurse to sleep has gotten so much more difficult, he’d rather keep climbing around and getting up 😔he’s do it it for ever 🙄 I try to get him back down and make him nurse. This feels like I’m forcing him and I don’t want that. But it also reaches my emotional limits. Makes me MAD. 
I let him play during the day as he wishes but still the bed seems more attractive for that.

I am nursing my third baby and he is 18 months soon, I am having such a hard time because he wants to  nurse several times in an hour, for comfort. He doesn't really nurse more so pacifys.  am so burnt out from this. I have been reading up on it and all I am getting is that sometimes toddlers will have periods where they want to nurse more, but this kid has always been like this. I am staying with my mom for a couple months who is very pro extended breast feeding and she told me today he is out of control with the nursing lol. I think I have made things worse by trying to set limits but then not following through when he throws a tantrum. Now if I try to say no he just instantly goes into a full blown screaming fit. I will add that i dont believe he is in pain, and he is developing normally and on track for 18 months. I literally cannot sit down in my own home without him coming for my boobs lol.

687,AttachmentParenting,"Hi AP community,
I’m looking for any insights from other parents with high energy easily frustrated babies. I don’t have many friends with babies and as a FTM I haven’t had many opportunities to see how my son compares to others. 

He is almost 1 and we happily practice AP parenting in a variety of ways. However one area I struggle with is how easily frustrated he is and consequently how much of the day he spends crying! 

Cutting up food for him results in constant squawking and screeching until it’s ready, if he’s in his high chair he constantly wants to be passed different things to play with but then throws them away in frustration, if he can’t make us understand what he wants instantly it’s full on screaming until we figure it out. Even carrying him around he screeches trying to get to different things within his sight. 

He has a play room next to the kitchen with a baby gate to keep the dogs out. Up until this point he won’t go in there without me being physically in there, which I know is developmentally appropriate. However I’ve been trying to work on even one minute at a time with me being on the other side of the gate within view, but it’s constant screaming till I go in or pick him up!

688,AttachmentParenting,"Hi All, hoping for some suggestions that may have helped similar parents pls:

We have a 20 month old girl who has never been a great sleeper after we have put her to bed. 

In her prime (around 17-18 months) she would go down in her cot 7:30pm > wake 11ish > wake 4ish (come to our bed) > 7am ready to party.

But then sickness, teething, covid 😔, sick again has really off-set her and her new routine has been: 7:30 Asleep in cot: 830 awake and demanding cuddles+refusing to go back to sleep in cot (now an expert in knowing when we sneak her down?!) 

We've had to pretty much give up and allow her to sleep/cuddle in the middle of our bed for the whole night.

She's slowly regressing from breastfeeding with Mum (1.5 each night on average). 

She's always needed cuddles and story time in the rocking chair to fall asleep -(this part has gotten easier and faster), however she has rarely ever 'self soothed', so we would always have to come in when she would escalate her wake ups to settle her down. -latley this has been every hour after bedtime.

We really focus on lots of sunlight, excercise, fresh air, waking her up around 7-730, healthy eating, ensuring she has a good nap (has recently moved to 1 a day) and even tried iron supplements of late. Kind of running out of options now and I feel we've lost the battle in the last couple months of her understanding her cot is where she sleeps and mum+dad's bed is only allowed in the early mornings...

My daughter has always been hypersensitive and she has always cried a lot. I know I need to validate her experience and emotions but I am drained.

This morning she cried after waking up because baby brother wasn’t looking at her (she was in the staircase, far away). It didn’t even make sense. Then she had a crisis and pouted and cried when telling me that she didn’t want that bread. She then hit her finger on the table and cried like she had a broken bone. She later one cried because her friend was walking ahead of her and because she wanted food that I did not have.

Today I was outside with my 3 month old and my neighbour came over to chat with her 10 month old. While I was holding my daughter I heard the telltale sound of a squelch so I started to excuse myself to go change her and she told me I was setting myself up for stress changing her so quickly after a poop.

She said that you should always leave them for 5-10 minutes in a dirty diaper so their skin gets used to it because if you can’t always change it immediately they won’t have any resistance and can get an infection or extreme diaper rash from that one time.

The only time I could think of that I couldn’t change it immediately would be in the car and I would put extra barrier cream on though and we RARELY go anywhere that’s longer than a 5 minute drive…

Is this a valid worry? If the only trade off of always changing her immediately is that I’ll always need to change her immediately that’s fine. Both husband and I work from home, both consider ourselves the default parent, whenever either of us hear a poop it’s insta change and her schedule is pretty consistent so far.

704,AttachmentParenting,"Hi! I’m not sure where best to ask this but I thought I should start here since I bedshare and can not and will not change that. This is very long (sorry) but I think the context is important. 

My dad got covid in January and since I live in Japan and my family is in the US I was staying up until 2am every night to hear from my sister and get messages from my dad in the hospital. My son (2 years old) would wake up every time because we bedshare and if I leave the room even to go to the bathroom he cries. He’s fine being without me any other time except at night. Eventually it turned into him staying up until 2am with me because I couldn’t sleep, and us sleeping in together the next morning. I was depressed and sleep schedules didn’t really change our day (playing in the park, walks, etc) because at that time I still wasn’t taking my son out to stores for fear of covid.

Then in February my dad passed from covid and it was months of just getting by, trying to be the best mom I could but being extremely depressed. My (Japanese) husband wasn’t able to change his work schedule either so I was pretty much alone with no time to grieve on my own. I found I still couldn’t sleep until about 3am after he died and my son was the same. Obviously in my depression getting out of bed was hard and so our sleep schedule basically became 3am-1pm and I didn’t have the emotional energy to change it because it was more important that I was still talking my son outside and making every day fun for him.

Now months later I’m coping better with my grief and I’ve finally been taking my son to stores but I can’t seem to change his sleep schedule. If he falls asleep at 11 or later it’s perfect but if he falls asleep at 9 or even 10 he wakes up an hour later as if it were a nap and is ready to play and won’t fall asleep until 2am or worse. This also happens if he takes a nap any later than 5pm, no matter how long. I get him up early and try to make him nap in the early afternoon or even just before 5pm but he often won’t sleep. Then he’ll be tired and fall asleep while we’re on the train or in the car and even if I wake him up an hour after that it results in him not being able to sleep for the night until much later even if he woke up early that day.

It seems his sleep is determined by his nap times and not how long he sleeps total and I just don’t know what to do. I have a good bedtime routine, no TV, dimmed lights, bath and books, etc…and when he can’t sleep he’s jumping around on our bed in the dark. I think one issue is that his dad gets home around 10pm which he knows and he wants to see his dad so he tries to stay up. But even if he would fall asleep at 11pm (which is when my husband goes to sleep) it would be manageable but he won’t unless he’s had his nap earlier than 5pm. Perhaps another important detail is that my mother in law watches him from 1-3pm, she can’t do any other time, and due to my husband’s work schedule that’s the only help I get on the weekdays and I need it. That would be the best time for my son to nap but he wants to play so he won’t. 

We get up at 6:30am and ideally he would nap at around 10:30 or 11 and then fall asleep for the night sometime that isn’t in the early AM, I’ll take any time I can get honestly. But what usually happens is he wakes at 6:30am, finally falls asleep at 7pm after me trying everything to get him to nap and he wakes a few hours later ready to start his day not falling asleep until 2am or, if I wake him up an hour later, still stays up until 2am anyway. I don’t know how to make him take a set nap time or sleep through the night from an earlier time. Stores and trains are crowded (and it’s miserably hot) in the afternoon so it’s necessary for us to start our day early.

714,AttachmentParenting,"Just a little mini rant. 
It's frustrating when literally everyone, including your own husband, is against your parenting style. My son is sleepy so he's cranky. We were sitting on the floor playing and I got up to go to the kitchen and he immediately started crying. My husband goes ""why are you so attached to mommy?"" And I jokingly said ""it's cause I'm so awesome."" And he says ""no, it's cause he knows you're gonna pick him up"" to which I replied ""uh, yeah. That's kind of the whole point."" 


We were at a point where he didn't question how I did things, especially considering I'm the default parent. But his sister just got home with twins, and they're already adamant about holding them as little as possible and not comforting them if they fuss or cry.

715,AttachmentParenting,"Hi, my daughter is almost 10 months old and we've been cosleeping on a floor bed from very early on. And it's worked out amazingly. She's always been a good sleeper. Around 6 months we started working on independent sleep and did some gentle sleep training and she was taking naps and going to bed so great in the floor bed. She usually falls asleep as soon as we leave the room. 

She's been crawling for a while now but yesterday she left the floor bed 3 times. Or rather she made a conscious decision to take a leap and fall face first off the floor bed in order to leave. I had put her down for an afternoon nap after she showed sleep/tired cues and close to the time she would usually go. However she was fighting it and wanted to leave. I even tried putting something soft around the bed but she intentionally avoided it. 

We've tried to teach her how to get out of the bed safely and by turning around and going feet first. We've been trying to teach this for weeks in the event she wanted to get off the bed. So I'm not sure what we can do there except keep trying to teach her how to disembark the safe way. I don't want her hitting her head or continuing to fall out of the floor bed. It's not far (merely 5 inches) but from downstairs the sound of my baby falling to the floor is pretty upsetting. We did contact naps for so long but she seems to struggle with contact naps. Like she can't get comfortable so I don't see much choice other than to try and make independent naps in the crib or pack n play work. 

So we tried putting her in the crib. And when I come to bed at night I take her out of the crib and bring her to the floor bed and she cosleeps with me for the remainder of her night and we have zero issues with that. It works fine for bedtime but it is taking her longer to fall asleep. But naps are awful and don't seem to be working out. I'm really struggling to get her to nap in the crib. She just cries and cries and cries. Right now it's been about 45 minutes. Is this nornal? I wasn't planning on using the crib but I can't really handle the stress of her falling out of the floor bed.

724,AttachmentParenting,"I was having a conversation with my mum the other day, and she recounted that I needed to be rocked to sleep until I was a year and a half old. 

It is currently how I am putting my 3 month old baby to sleep, whether for naps or for the night, and even rocking her to sleep can take ages. I have to admit, what she said worried me, as my baby is already as heavy as some six month olds, and rocking her to sleep for hours every day is already hurting my back. 

I know she is still young but I was wondering how much sleep “training”, for lack of a better word, is in line with AP and a secure bond? For example, would it be bad if I started putting her down to sleep “drowsy but awake” and if she doesn’t settle, talking to her, shushing her and carressing her, but not picking her back up, until she hopefully goes back to sleep? I would never ever do CIO, if I were to do this method, I would go to her everytime she cried or fussed, but I was wondering if it still counts as sleep training if I don’t do what she wants me to do, i.e. pick her up, and if I am comforting her but without picking her up. 

I tried briefly today but not much success, she couldn’t go back to sleep until I had picked her up and rocker her back to sleep. To be fair I didn’t like seeing her agitated so I didn’t persevere too much…I am just worried this is sleep training and wanted other people who practice AP’s thoughts on helping your baby to fall sleep independently? 

The not being able to fall asleep without rocking for hours at night is not even the worst part, but at the moment, during daytime naps, everytime she comes out of a sleep cycle, I need to rock her back to sleep, as she can’t resettle at all. During her longer 2 hour nap that she likes having around 3pm every day, this can happen as many as 4 times. 

People I have spoken to who do AP all had conflicting views: one person thought I should rock her to sleep as long as she wants, and said that even if I am physically present and not letting her cry, not picking her up is ignoring her needs, one person though the above sounded fine but only from 6 months onwards, and one person thought trying from now but not putting too much stock in how successful it is can’t hurt.

727,AttachmentParenting,"Hey parents, I recently came across something just briefly in passing that said if your baby wakes every night at the same exact times or after the same amount of sleep it could be more habit based than need based (although I think the need for cuddles is obviously a thing.) 


So each night I feed my daughter (9.5 months) to sleep. I put her down at 7 and usually at 11 she wakes for her first night feed. Tonight though she slept a bit longer - very rare for her, and sleep until just after 1. I feed her and put her back down easily just like always. Then at 3 I can hear her up again. I try to rub her back and she almost goes back to sleep. So then I think… she can’t be hungry? So I rock and rock, she’s almost asleep but then wakes up again. So I feed her and she goes to sleep.


Is this just that she is only comforted by breast? Does anyone know anything about the habit of waking at the same times?

733,AttachmentParenting,"Our daughter (5 months old) has been sleeping in a ""sidecar"" crib immediately adjacent to our bed: we've removed the front wall of the crib, and the crib surface is flush with our bed surface, which is very convenient in the middle of the night so that my wife can easily pull baby close. (Our understanding is that this is a pretty common sleeping arrangement, especially in the AP world.)

What do we do about naps, now that baby is capable of locomoting?

She's not exactly crawling yet, but she's definitely capable of moving herself around (either by rolling or by smushing her face into the mattress and pushing with her legs). Leaving her alone in the three-wall crib isn't safe; she can and will escape onto the big bed and then crawl to the edge of it and fall off. (We've removed the boxspring, so it's not *that* far a fall from the surface of the bed to the ground. But still, not good.)

The particular crib we have doesn't make it easy to attach and detach the fourth wall; we can do it, but it's not the kind of thing we want to have to do every morning and evening.

I'm guessing maybe the AP answer is that my wife should nap along with baby? But she wants to have an option available where she can leave the room and get stuff done.

We could just get another crib (with four walls) and put it in the ""baby's room"" (which so far the baby has never slept in because she's been sleeping in our room) and use that one for naps while still using the sidecar crib in our bedroom for overnight sleep. I guess that'd work, but baby has enough trouble sleeping that I don't love the idea of trying to get her accustomed to an entirely new room right now.

We've attempted to find cribs or bassinets that have an easily-raised-and-lowered fourth wall, but we're in Canada and IIUC that kind of thing is illegal because the government thinks cosleeping is unsafe.

I'd really like to attempt to get her night weaned (and then, eventually, into her own bed... and then eventually move that bed into her big sisters room) but I just don't know how to go about it. There isn't really another way to get her back to sleep other than nursing. Even if I manage to make it through most of the night without nursing, the real problem is the early morning. Starting at around 4am, she wakes a lot/nurses a lot. It's the only way to keep her asleep during that time. If I try to not nurse her then we are just going to be starting our day at 4am.

We have a 13, (almost 14) month old. We are in a sleep regression that's been going on almost a month. Baby is waking up 4 times a night. Baby's top two teeth came in and started walking, and yet the regression continues. We used to have a kind of predictable schedule but we can't figure it out now -- the baby skips second nap a lot of the time, and even skips the first nap sometimes. The skipped naps don't seem to help nighttime at all. 

For naps we still do contact naps with the baby in our arms in the rocker. I'm still breastfeeding, so I also still nurse to sleep. I'm hesitant to stop contact naps because I love the snuggles, but I worry that it's keeping baby from wanting to sleep in her crib at night, even though we we've done contact naps all along. At night baby sleeps in a crib in our room. To get to sleep, I breastfeed baby and put the baby down once baby's sound asleep. Drowsy but awake has never worked for us, it wakes baby up more and baby starts screaming. We use a sound machine. We have a paci.

We have been cuddling her to sleep (before a little routine: bath, reading books) then, after she is asleep, we are moving her to her crib. She also got used to hold our hands while falling asleep. 

I wouldn't mind putting her to sleep like that, but her constant waking up is getting into my nerves. For example today my husband put her to sleep at 19.30, since then she woke up 4 times (and it is only 22:00 here now). 

Also, usually around midnight she is waking up and that's when we are moving her to our bed. With us she is sleeping without waking up. But we have a small bed (only 140 cm width), so it is hard to have a proper sleep with her there...

746,AttachmentParenting,"Hi! So first of all I want to clarify that we wouldn't be taking his toys away from him, they'd just be moved to other areas of the house. 

We recently bought and moved into a 3 bedroom house in April. We had a spare bedroom so decided to put all of our sons toys in there and he could use it as his playroom. It's not a huge room but definitely big enough to play with toys in there. 

The thing is though, he doesn't use it. He plays with all of his toys downstairs, meaning when we tidy up we have to take everything back upstairs and then the next day he brings it all back down anyway.

He also likes to play with his toys in our bedroom, which there is definitely not enough room for because our bed and in-built wardrobes take up most of the room, and after that it's a narrow, awkwardly shaped space to play with toys in.

I don't like the idea of taking something away that we said is his, but it's being put to absolutely no use when I could just put his toys in his room or whatever, and have the other room used as a guest bedroom.

747,AttachmentParenting,"Not sure if I have an attached parenting style, so I'm just looking for some insight. 

I have an 8 month old son. I think he's absolutely perfect. He's so sweet and funny, and I have loved watching him learn and grow. I'm a stay at home mom so Im the primary caregiver. Our biggest issue currently well, for the past couple months, is that he only wants me or my husband. He doesn't want anyone else to hold him, even if its someone he was previously comfortable with. At home he's a little more relaxed, and will typically be okay playing on his own if I'm nearby. If we are away from home, the second I try to put him down he screams and cries. This, unfortunately has warranted a lot of comments from the in laws about how spoiled he is, or how he's too attached to me, or how I need to learn to put him down. I'm at a point where I can't take the comments anymore. I would have my husband handle it, but he agrees with them. So most of the time it feels like it's me and my baby against the world. 

I just wanna know. Am I doing something wrong? Am I setting my baby up for failure since 99% of the time he just wants to be close to me? Do babies typically grow out of this phase? For awhile I ignored the comments but its at the point where it's getting to me and I'm questioning everything. I've just been doing what feels right. I respond to his cries. I feed him when he's hungry. If he wants to be held I pick him up. Is that really so bad? If I need to do something like use the bathroom or shower then obviously I put him somewhere safe and do what I need to do so he does fuss and cry sometimes. But he puts himself to sleep for naps and bedtime and he sleeps in his crib so at least there's that?

Now, I give him a bath (if he needs one), get him into his pyjamas, lay him down in bed, me and his daddy take turns in reading a few pages each from a book (at the moment it's Alice In Wonderland), I stay with him for a minute after story time is over then I give him a kiss and a cuddle, say goodnight, remind him that if he needs me he can shout for me or come and get me, then I leave the room. He's then normally asleep within 10 minutes.

It was taking a toll on my mental health to lay in bed with him and sometimes wait 2+ hours for him to fall asleep, and sometimes he really resists anything to do with bedtime so when I'd get frustrated with that, the last thing I'd want to do is lay in bed with him but I would because I felt it was my duty.

Is it too late to remedy any issues I may have caused by not looking at her eyes while feeding her? Am I overthinking it and she’s fine? I worry she has spent hours and hours feeding in a “still face” experiment.

Background: I’m working through some mild postpartum anxiety (in therapy, considering meds but not there yet). One of my biggest fears is that not looking her in the eyes while feeding her for the last 8 weeks has done irreparable damage. 

Breastfeeding was really difficult for me (and it’s still pretty tough), and I got in a bad habit of looking at my cell phone while feeding her.  I think I did this because 1) I was/am so tried that I needed something to keep me awake, and 2) I sometimes got anxious/worried while looking at her (this ended after 3-4 weeks) and I was trying to relax by looking at my phone so breastfeeding would be more successful. 

I also had a traumatic labor which caused me to struggle to connect with her in other ways initially. 

I feel more connected to her now, and in therapy I’m working on my anxiety and confidence as a mom. I’m a little better with eye contact, but I have a way to go and I believe this source of anxiety is my biggest hurdle.

774,AttachmentParenting,"Hi all! Ahhhh so another ""please save our sleep"" post.

Little one is a week shy of 6 months. We co sleep using a sidecar cot most of the night and have recently started bedsharing for part of the night as well. Up until about 3 mo, LO was going down between 8-10 pm, doing 2-3 hour stretches and would nurse back to sleep each time, then up for the day about 7 am. A dream.

Then the 4 mo sleep regression hit and we had about 2 months of waking every 40-60 minutes. At about 5 mo, the good nights (2-4 hr stretches) started to outnumber the bad which lasted about a week. Then bedtime started getting later... and later... until baby was wanting to party until midnight every night. This was around the 4 to 3 nap transition, so we dropped that extra nap pretty naturally and I experimented with capping her day sleep at 3 hours (had previously been letting her sleep as long as she wanted because she'd always been so resistant to napping and I figure her body knows what she needs, but these days she will happily sleep 3+ hours at a time if we let her) to see if that helped move her bedtime back to around 9 pm.

It did. However, her night sleep has gone absolutely completely to shit, either cooincidentally or not. She either wakes every hour or wakes up at 2 am and wants to party for 3 hours before she goes back to sleep. Everything I read points to her being undertired but there is no way this is the case. She has a 4 hour wake window before bed because she will not settle with less than that. She just had a night of less than 8 hrs total sleep (thanks to a 3 hour wake period from 1 am) and was absolutely raging this morning because she was so tired, so I'm currently letting her nap as long as she wants (going on 3 hours...) because even if she and I don't sleep at all tonight, I'm not having her upset and sleepy all day. Could this be another developmental period where sleep is just crap and it just cooincided with my nap capping experiment? Could she actually be so _overtired_ that her night sleep has gone to hell? She was so cranky and tired yesterday and still slept awfully last night. 

No sign of teeth and she doesn't seem upset during the night wake ups, anyway. We've also recently (the past few days) started some solids, but self feeding and she isn't consuming an appreciable amount yet.

778,AttachmentParenting,"Attachment Parenters of Reddit, I would love your help.

My 12 month old is my world. But good god, she is not a good sleeper. Late bedtimes, false starts, lots of wakeups, etc. We recently dropped to 1 nap, which helped with the late bedtime, and now we're transitioning away from bedsharing. I desperately want my bed (and my sleep) back! Typically I've been getting in bed with her at her first wakeup, around 10:30. We EBF, but our nanny sometimes gets her to take a formula bottle.

She naps in her crib no problem, so she's definitely used to it. Her one nap is around 2 hours long, at 12:30.

We've done 2 nights so far where I've successfully not brought her into bed with me until the early hours, which IYKYK is a feat in and of itself, hah. But the wakeups are...bad. Especially now that I have to get out of bed, rock her back to sleep, transfer to crib, then try to go back to sleep myself. I am SO SO SO tired. 

Here's how it's going:

Night 1:

* Asleep 7:45
* Up at 8:45, 10:30 (nursed), 2:45, 3:40 (nursed), 6:30 (got in bed with her, nursed)
* 7:45 up for the day

Night 2:

* Asleep 8:00
* Up at 8:30, 10:30 (nursed), 12:30, 2:10 (nursed), 5:50 (got in bed with her, nursed)
* 7:45 up for the day

QUESTION: Should night weaning be taking place simultaneously, like will that help her sleep longer chunks if she's not expecting the boob? I'm ready to wean anyway, but I'm not sure if that's a separate event that should wait until after this transition.

NOTES: She is getting molars, and learning to walk! Maybe these factors are not helping? She's been getting Motrin at bedtime. For the most part, she typically goes right back down easily after all wakeups.

HELP: Is this even the right way to accomplish this transition? I am just so hopeless and skeptical that this will lead to her sleeping longer in the crib.",Am I doing this wrong?? Transitioning 1 year old from co-sleeping to crib,1657569016.0

787,AttachmentParenting,"Hi there,

We practice gentle and attachment parenting and my toddler will be around 2.5 when new baby is born. 

Was hoping for literature recommendation for me and toddler as well as any advice regarding bringing baby home and making the transition as comfortable as possible for toddler. 

I am a SAHM and our entire world is currently dedicated to her. It will obviously be difficult for her when I need to split my time suddenly. I am intending on giving birth in my home country where my family will help out with toddler for the first few weeks, she is obsessed with Aunty and grandpa, so hopefully that will be ok at first. It’s when we go back home around week 6 where we have no family or support that will probably be the most difficult. 

Thank you in advance!!",How to prepare toddler for new baby,1657453591.0
788,AttachmentParenting,"My baby is nearly 5 months. I am the birth parent, he is exclusively breastfed and I am on maternity and the main carer for him. 

Since he was a few weeks old he naturally stopped going down for any naps in the day and so all of his naps have mostly been contact naps/ in the baby carrier. The only exceptions are in the car seat or pram when we go out. This was completely fine obviously I know it's natural for baby to need the comfort and closeness and I just made the most of the cuddles and stuck on netflix when he contact napped. Though he would sleep on me well since a few weeks in he has been extremely difficult to get to sleep in the daytime as he won't nurse to sleep in the day. At night however he slept well in his crib next to our bed. We would cosleep occasionally but he would mostly sleep in there. I would nurse to sleep then transfer him and again for each night waking do the same. 

Then the 4 month sleep regression hit around 15 weeks. He was still contact napping and just as difficult to get to sleep but would only nap for 30 minutes at a time and then at night was back to waking hourly and boob wouldn't always satisfy him. He then started refusing going into his crib so we have ended up cosleeping full time. Cosleeping causes my hips and legs a lot of physical pain which I've just pushed through.

Alongside this he has also started to recognise me as his main carer and even if he is happily playing in his play mat if I leave the room just to get a drink of water/ food or just to go to the toilet he starts crying- really crying. If he wakes up in his dad's arms/ next to his dad on the bed and I'm not there he starts screaming. He also cries a lot when he is tired. The crying and screaming is so hard to hear and I also get a hormonal response where I start sweating like crazy. 

He has become really hard to sooth because when he is upset we have to be stood up with him to sooth him and he wont sooth if I hold him whilst sitting or lying down. He is getting heavier and very fidgety so will yank my hair try and shuffle his bum, lean back etc which all makes it really hard work to carry him so I just end up baby wearing him a lot at home.

I feel really burned out at the moment with him because there is just no break day or night. If I could have time and space to myself back at night then I could cope with the days. I'm someone who has always needed time alone to recharge and I just feel like I'm running on empty at the moment. 

I know all of this is normal behaviour. And also just want to say I know this all sounds very negative but I do really love being a mother and I love my son like nothing else, it's just all getting a bit too much. I read online about babies the same age just being so much calmer and content and less 'demanding' and it makes me start doubting myself whether I've been doing the right thing and whether I've been too responsive so now he can't cope without me. I know really that's not true and I wouldn't want to be doing the things that I see other people doing like sleep training but if I read one more time about the importance of putting baby down drowsy but awake and having a good bedtime routine I'm going to lose my mind.

Because of his size and increasing mobility, we had to lower his mattress and he is now pretty much floor level.

798,AttachmentParenting,"What I’m writing is a theory; please do not take it as fact. If you think about learning and you think about fear, both are similar in that they change behavior. I think that many skills that are thought of as learned skills actually came to be through a process of having experienced fear (sleeping through the night for young infants, infants not crying in ways that look like emotional regulation, etc.) Because I think there is something to this, I have a quick set of criteria about when to be suspicious of methods that purport to be learning but really are changing behavior through causing fear. Here is my list of red flags that people use when describing a process of behavior change: 
1. The infant overcame crying or resistance on his own or her own (without the introduction of something known to comfort babies: parental presence, boobies, etc.) after having been really upset 
2. No approximations of a new behavior before the changed behavior happens. The infant just kind of snaps into a new mode of being without the experimentation that is a hallmark of learning or without the introduction of a comfort item.

Things turned out differently for our 2nd. We moved 1 hr away but kept our daughter at the same school. We got a nanny for our son, so he wouldn’t need to spend 3 hrs a day in the car (to/from school,  small talk with other parents, errands on the way home).

810,AttachmentParenting,"I know this is probably something I just need to get past but oh my god I'm so over bedtime. I'd gladly take any suggestions but mostly need to just get this out. I feel like I can't vent to anyone in person because they either tell me to sleep train, or act like I deserve this for not sleep training. 

My 19mo has always been a low sleep needs baby. He typically sleeps 10hr per night and a 1.5-2hr nap. On a typical day he wakes up around 7, goes down for nap around 11-12, then falls asleep somewhere around 9. I have tried everything I can think of to try to get him to sleep earlier but obviously I can't \*force\* him to sleep. Every night we do his bedtime routine and I bring him in to bed around 7:30, then he is just awake until 9. Either trying to run around the room, turning the lights on and off, climbing me, generally flopping around, etc. I'm sure you know the drill. Lately he has even been putting himself to bed - he will say ""sleep, sleep"", and physically push or pull me into the bedroom around 7:30. I cannot understand why he pushes me to bed, yet doesn't want to sleep? 

&#x200B;

To add a wrench, I was really hoping to have him weaned by now. He still nurses to sleep for naps and falls asleep quickly nearly every nap. For bedtime he will nurse forever and never stop or go to sleep, until I hit the point where I can't take it and cut it off. I'm 33 weeks pregnant and have a major nursing aversion, but weaning is just DIFFICULT. He's been night weaned for about 6 months now and only nurses before nap and bed. 

&#x200B;

He gets no shortage of attention and energy out all day. I am a SAHM and my husband works remotely so he is with us all day. We do all our meals together and are basically just on top of each other all the time, so I don't think it's an attention thing. Our typical loose schedule:  
7: Wake up, walk the dogs  
8: breakfast, indoor play  
9:30 activity out of house (storytime, music class, toddler gym, park, etc.)  
11:30 lunch, nap  
2:00 snack, play for rest of afternoon, possibly run an errand together if needs doing (groceries, post office, etc.)  
5:30 walk dogs  
6:00 independent play while I cook, or play with dad  
6:30 family dinner  
7:00 bath if needed. Books, wind down for bedtime  
7:30 go into bedroom  
9:00 kid finally nods off, mom comes out feeling burnt out and defeated  


Anyway, this was probably way too much information but I thought maybe typing it all out might help me look for insights as well. I'm worried about how this is going to go when the new baby comes in August. There's no reason why he \*has\* to go to bed at 7:30 and not 9, it's an arbitrary time, but also this kid is TIRED and I want to help him! This morning he walked .5mi with the dogs, went to the park around the corner and ran around twice, went to the trampoline park for an hour and a half, played outside with his water table for an hour, and walked another .5mi with the dogs!

It HURTS, omg it hurts. And without the my actual milk on top of the pain he's taking a long time to get back to sleep.

I was pretty surprised at the reaction since it seems harmless to me to let the kid decide who will give him a bath if both parents are available, and I guess I agree with the OP of the post that family evening chats while on vacation are not that important and it was OK to pull dad away from that to help his son. 

The comments are saying she is dismissive of the conversation being important but also that in giving into her son, she is spoiling him and not raising him right. I was curious how you folks here would handle the issue. 

If my husband was in a scheduled meeting I wouldn't pull him out of it to help with a fussy toddler, but if he was having perceived leisure time I wouldn't hesitate to ask him to help if his toddler wanted him.

In the past couple of weeks though (she’s currently 10 weeks old), she has become really fussy when carried in any way, either in arms or in a baby carrier. She has always been really active and kicky, but it’s gotten to the point where it just looks like she really wants to explore kicking and her movements which she can’t do that well when she is worn.

826,AttachmentParenting,"I need some reassurance that I'm not ""hurting"" my toddler and that I'm doing the ""right"" thing. Is letting her cry for milk okay? Should I be doing something different? This is what's going on:

She's 15 months today and we started night weaning her two nights ago. This was prompted by a pediatrician that we were referred to because she started rejecting solids at 11 months and being very picky so she's not getting all the nutrients that she should be getting. From 7 to 11 months old, she used to do a 6-hour stretch the first half of the night and would wake up every 2-3 hours after that with nursing back to sleep. At 11 months, she would wake up every 2-3 hours. She basically ate all night so I see why the pediatrician would recommend night weaning. She did say that it might or might not work for having longer stretches of sleep but at least she'll be less full in the morning and might eat more solids. I see the logic but I know that there are no guarantees. 

The first night, she went to bed at 8 p.m., had a false start and I went in. She cried on and off for an hour. It broke my heart but I was there the whole time comforting her while she screamed for milk. She rejected her pacifier and only wanted the boob. I caved and nursed her to sleep in the end because I couldn't take it anymore. She woke up at 1 a.m. and I put my nipple in but switched it real fast to a pacifier that she took. Woke up at 5 a.m. and I nursed her back to sleep. 

Yesterday, she woke up after 2 hours. Daddy went in and she cried for 30 minutes while he rubbed her back and fell asleep. Woke up at 1 a.m. and I sleep with her so I rubbed her back, patted her butt, etc but she cried on and off for an hour (I think, I fell asleep a few times when she calmed down and woke up when she started crying again).

I've pulled off her latch, while firmly grabbing her hand and sternly saying no. Literally does not phase her. I even explain my boundary,  I will not let you pinch me. I know she doesn't understand but I like to think it's good gentle parenting practice. I've given her her stuffy, a blanket,  nope. It's my skin she craves. Redirection isn't working. And this is happening as she's falling asleep. So I can't move away or she'll cry and wake my poor husband whose got a sleep debt from his baby shifts. (I'm the lucky parent who gets to sleep in with her,  so I'm well rested all the time,  mean while he's falling asleep at his desk at work. So I owe it to him as an equal parent partner for making the sacrifice.) Don't have a safe alternative for sleep because her room is currently storage for another two weeks while we're going through a transition in our lives with my new job.

Anyways. Logical me understands she is either exploring the texture of my skin or testing her limits. Considering this seems to happen subconsciously, as she does it in light sleep as well,  I'm thinking the former. 

Emotional me however is ready to yeet this tiny monster off my dang bed. Or pinch her back.  I will not. But it's cathartic writing it out. 

I have a head ache because I'm clenching my jaw for 30 minutes as I fight this little crab of a child as gently as possible.

I understand she has non existent impulse control. But my poor chest and shoulders are red and irritated from her practicing her pincer grab. Please let this pass quickly. Two weeks can't get here fast enough. Night weaning is coming and we're ganna transition her to her own room. I can at least say I made it a year.

831,AttachmentParenting,"Did night weaning help your baby sleep longer stretches? What age did you start/how did you know it was time/what methods worked for you? Did you see an increase, decrease or same amount/length of night wakings?

Concerned that baby will continue to wake and that nursing will no longer be an option for getting back down, possibly resulting in less sleep than we have now. Not sure if this is a concern only for younger babies or if it also happens with toddlers. I feel able to wake 1-2 times between 10-5, but every hour or two from 7:30pm-7am has taken its toll.

Husband, baby (12.5 mo), and I have bedshared since birth. Naps are now 2x/ day for total of about 2-3 hours. Night wakings have been every 1-3 hours since about 4 mo. We have a crib mattress on the floor next to our big bed which is also on the floor, and baby will sleep on it but still wakes the same amount (was wondering if he was waking from being too hot or from our movements). Is definitely getting nutrition still from night nursing, has days when he eats a lot of solids and days when he doesn’t but nursing/waking times are unaffected by daytime eating. Used to nurse back down every time, now (give no teething, illness, etc) will sometimes go back to sleep with pats or cuddles, sometimes not.

UPDATE: Appreciate the replies. As much as Id like to get in 3-4 hour stretches, even though he does not need to nurse every time, I don’t think there are enough signals to indicate readiness to wean at night yet. I remember reading Dr Jay Gordon‘s tips, which coinciding with the comments here and the LLL publications, gives hope that around 18 months when the child is more able to understand what you explain, and hopefully eating more solids, would be a good time to try and just back off and wait if it feels wrong.

833,AttachmentParenting,"So the last two months, I’ve slowly been cutting back on nursing to sleep and replacing it with rocking in bed. For the first month, he would want to nurse after rocking. But this past month, he’s stopped asking for a nurse after the rocking about half the time. The past week, it has really started working. He is now starting to unlatch and wait for me to rock him, he likes the rocking. When he’s asleep, I lay him down on the bed we share. Sometimes he wakes up and goes back to sleep, but sometimes he wakes up and will fuss, so I have to nurse him for the night. When he does wake up and puts himself bad to sleep, he sleeps sooooo good, he hardly wakes up the whole night. The last two days, I started rocking him in the chair/rocker, versus while sitting in bed (the type of rock that’s an ab workout), and then laying him down in our bed. I think tomorrow I’m going to try laying him in the crib versus our bed. He hates the crib, I hope it goes well. It’s been a really really slow process. Even though we have soft carpet and the mattress on the floor, I still don’t sleep well because we wake each other up all night. He loves crawling off half the time, and loves pulling my hair, kissing/biting me, and climbing all over me. I’m just ready.

834,AttachmentParenting,"My son turned 6 months on the 20th, but for the last month or so he’s gotten really good at rolling back and forth… too good. He rolls onto his stomach in his sleep, and he’s almost rolled off the bed a few times (thankfully I’m a light sleeper and wake up any time he moves). We’ve noticed any time we move in bed, it wakes him up and think it might be time for his own sleep space.

Before he was born, we had set up an entire nursery that’s been mostly untouched except the occasional diaper change and feeding when guests are over. It’s basically just a baby stuff storage room lol. We’re planning on cleaning out the nursery today and start the slow transition to him sleeping in his own bed. There’s a few things I’m worried about though.

First, he’s a serial nurser at night. This baby loves the boobie. Any time he stirs, he immediately looks for a boobie. Im wondering how this will affect him waking in the night. I think I’ll sleep on an air mattress in his room for a few nights (no room to bring his crib into ours or we would do that) and feed him back to sleep when he wakes. He’s just recently starting to like the paci, so I’m hoping that helps.

Second, he has a hard time falling asleep on his own and an even harder time being laid down on his back. To date he’s only ever napped either on me, beside me, or in a chair in front of me. Any attempt to lay him down without a boobie has been a failure. I’m hoping now that he’s older it will somehow be easier? How can I make this transition from arms to bed easier?

Third, and I know this might be selfish, but I don’t want him to sleep on his own. I love cuddling him at night. I love waking up to a baby snuggling me. I worry that if I transition him to crib, that I won’t be able to enjoy bed sharing occasionally anymore. But it really is the right thing to do with the space and circumstances.

Our baby boy is 7 months old (gee it’s crazy to say) and we used to be that very annoying couple whose baby just slept through the night with just waking early and that’s it. He was an amazing sleeper. 

Ever since we started solids a month ago he’s been waking 2-3-4 times a night and he absolutely won’t be soothed by anyone but me (mum). My husband tries but he’ll scream and toss around until he gets to me and then he’ll cuddle and sleep pretty much immediately. We put it down to being exclusively breastfed. 

We are worried now, as in September I’m starting full time work (with husband staying home with him), and I’ll need my sleep. Both him and the baby will need it too.

They also design it so that the parents attend with their kids in the first week and then slowly transition to the parents just dropping them off by the end of the 2 weeks.

I'm wondering if anyone else has issue with attending gatherings/parties with their little one. 

I'll mention that I don't think he's a highly sensitive kid - we go shopping, to the park, restaurants, etc. And he had very little if any issues; however, he always seems to melt down at family/friend parties or gatherings. These aren't big raging parties - and to me, they don't seem any more loud or chaotic than any other outings. We're trying to figure out how to make it less stressful for all of us.

A few things: he's almost 8 months, no siblings... The meltdowns almost always occur in the time between his last nap and bedtime. He'll be well-rested, fed, and happy before arriving, but generally becomes shy and grumpy quickly, typically leading to full blown inconsolable messes. 😢 Last time he managed almost 40 minutes - I had him in his carrier the whole time and I think it helped... But he still freaked out before we ended up leaving. 

Anyone else have this issue? Maybe it's the time (sort of a witching hour??) Or maybe he doesn't enjoy the attention being on him - more people coming up and trying to interact with him at a friend's party than at a restaurant??

I somehow have 3 thermometers and can’t work any of them. I have an expensive touchless one that gives me wildly different readings in every spot. The current method I’m using is a simple digital thermometer under her armpit (which she hates) but even then it seems like a different reading within seconds of redoing it. And specific to bedsharing- baby sleeps on her side cuddled up next to me. The side facing up is ice cold, skin is super cold. Side facing down is burning hot. Which armpit is accurate- is either accurate? If it reads 103 on the hot side do I panic or say oh that’s because it’s the hot side? She usually sleeps with clothes on and I’m second guessing that maybe her skin always feels this hot and I just didn’t realize.

Background: My boy is just over 5 months, we are not sleep training and not planning to do it. I'm based in Germany and I have 1 year long maternity leave so I'm open to try things and I have 0 pressure. He is EBF (started as a tripple feeding for the first 2 months). We are not co-sleeping in the same bed (not an option for us), but as almost everyone in Germany we are using a bedside crib, so he is always max 30cm away from me.

We did 100% feed to sleep for the first 2.5 months and it was great. At 2.5 months he started dropping his newborn naps and he stopped falling asleep even while being held. My mom was visiting and we naturally switched to eat, play, sleep during the day, but kept feed to sleep for the night. It was working pretty well. 

Recently we were travelling in Italy and I was offering him extra snacks to keep his good mood and avoid any dehydratation. He was still sleeping super well. Then we came back, he turned 5 months and BAM now our days are more like sleep (30min instead of 45-50), eat, sleep (anything between 15-60min but always a contact one), play, eat (I'm trying to prolong the first part of the nap)... It's a mess. He started waking up every 1-2h during the night as well. He was always on the low side of sleep, probably due to our long breastfeeding sessions but now it dropped to 10-11.5h (excluding breastfeeding time). It's been 3 weeks and I'm just so tired.

- Should I move back to feed to sleep for naps? I'm currently trying but he is treating those first sessions as 2-3min snacks while he properly eats to sleep after his first 30min nap
- Could it be that he has too many snacks sessions during the day and doesn't have enough for the night? We tried offering a bottle but he only took 40ml and still woke up every 1-2h

Almost every time he works try something, he would cough a lot and then just cry to get out of the chair, or throw up.I really didn't want him to eat processed junk food, but a couple weeks ago I caved and started giving him bread. It seemed like he needed something that could dissolve with just a little chewing. It worked, but now he's rejecting all veggies and fruits. I've just started giving him the same things every day in the hopes that enough repetition will just hello him learn one food at a time. 

Currently he gets scrambled eggs, pancakes, and various chopped up fruits and veggies for one meal a day. He gets solids twice a day, and purees 3x per day to get some calories and nutrition in him. He won't sleep without the purees. He has to eat solids and purees separately or he's very likely to vomit, so we're at 5 feedings a day. For his other feeding, we're still rotating beans, veggies, etc. He's getting the hang of pancakes and scrambled eggs slowly but won't really touch the other stuff. 

He can only eat a certain formula that costs $400 a month, which is currently going on a credit card, so I need him to be eating enough to switch off of formula at 12 months.

857,AttachmentParenting,"Please delete if not allowed!  I'm having a sibling issue with my toddler and preschooler I need feedback on how to solve with a respectful parenting approach.

I have a 3.75 year old girl and a 20 month old boy. They have a typical sibling relationship and love each other often and fight over toys/attention often. My daughter seeks a lot of physical affection and sensory input at times. Lately when she is tired or excited she is very physical with her little brother, hugging him, grabbing him, holding him on top of her, laying on him, etc. He sometimes enjoys the hugs for a second but quickly gets frustrated because he hates being constrained. He is young and has a mild speech delay so he definitely doesn't have the words to tell her to stop and she isn't reading the signs that he doesn't like it or is too impulsive for it to register. This often ends in him crying or biting her if I can't get to them fast enough and I'm worried it's dangerous if she's laying on top of him for more than a minute or so he won't get enough air. They aren't left unsupervised but I'm a SAHM with them all day and it's hard to be watching them like a hawk every second.

We talk constantly about consent and respecting ""space bubbles"" but the impulsivity takes over and it doesn't seem to help. I'm looking for suggestions for other age-appropriate language to use, ways to meet her need for more physical input, and tangible activities I can redirect her to when she gets in this mode.

Side note- I have considered a sensory processing disorder (especially because she had some tactile aversions when she was younger that she has largely grown out of). However, most of the time she regulates her arousal level fairly well and she regulates extremely well in less comfortable environments (like the store/library or when she used to attend daycare).

1. Thank you to everyone on this sub for sharing about your sleep highs and lows. I have been holding onto hope that I would get better sleep while maintaining the connection I’ve nurtured with my daughter.. some day. One thing that I needed to hear multiple times, was that it was ok for baby to cry/fuss in the arms of another caregiver while learning to sleep without suckling, and that is not CIO.

2. My 11.5 month old has been learning to sleep with dad the last three nights while I sleep in another room for the longest stretches since she was born. It’s really bittersweet to love her so much that I’m willing to “let go” of this closeness so she can learn to sleep with another caregiver. I’m not feeling rested yet but hope to soon. 

For those of you with a baby who used the breast to fall back asleep between sleep cycles, were you able to sleep in bed with them later on once they learned to sleep another way? 

My hope is that I can share a bed or room with her again without her wanting access to my boob all night.

He chose his own bedtime (lol) of 8 pm and his own wake up time of 6 am and has followed that since like, 1 week old lol. He sleeps wonderfully at night. Naps are just when he shows tires cues. He does seem to follow traditional wake windows for his age, though.

Lately, he often fights naps even when he’s tired, but I’ve chalked that up to the 4 month sleep regression and just soothe him through it. He seems to have shifted to being ready to sleep by 9 pm over the past week, cause when I go to put him down at 8, he’s a smiling, playing machine till 9 lol.

I’m curious, how long can we follow this routine? Is there a time that it would be developmentally better for me to provide structure? Is the child led schedule the reason he’s fighting naps, not a regression?

Also, can you put a FTM’s anxiety at ease…will keeping him child-led past 6-8 months cause any developmental delays?

She used to take four naps a day but now her naps are cut down to just two or three a day, making her grand total of daytime sleep just 1 hour to 1 and a half. I was giving her three naps a day but these past few weeks she has been fighting her third nap and bedtime so hard I just gave up on nap #3 it because I was too tired of her fighting sleep. Because of this she goes super long between her 2nd nap and bedtime (like 5 hours almost), but hasn’t been fighting bedtime sleep like she was earlier. 

She gets fussy and clingy near bedtime but I found that to be always the case. She is clearly very sleepy during the evening, but I really avoid letting her have a third nap now because she doesn’t cry and fight when I try to put her to sleep at bedtime.

Also, I noticed that on days I hold her during naps (and she naps longer because of this) she has a more restless nighttime sleep and was harder to resettle when she woke up. So I’ve been avoiding doing long contact naps because of this.

Also, she sleeps for a normal amount of time at night, usually around 11 hours (with three feeds throughout the night). On days she only gets two naps in she is usually able to spend most of the night in her crib, but when she has a longer nap she seems to need more help to sleep so I have to bed-share.

I think she’s doing okay with how little nap time she gets, but I doubt myself a lot. I read that sometimes babies who seem naturally fussy can just be lacking sleep. I mean my baby’s always seemed to be high needs and is generally only truly content when held (complains a lot otherwise), but could it be that I’m depriving her of sleep or is it truly her personality?

Since she is still so young, will basically letting other people care for her this weekend impact on her bonding with me?

My husband and I are expecting our first little one and have been doing lots of research on how we want to parent and foster healthy and secure attachment, which neither of us had with our parents. I’m really, really excited to break that cycle and practice attachment parenting with our baby.

My parents are both soooo eager to be involved (first grandchild) and are offering to watch baby in lieu of daycare once we go back to work. I love the idea, and my parents are great, loving people. BUT it makes me a tad concerned, because I want our baby to be raised differently and without most of the problematic things my parents did raising me (hitting, yelling, denying big feelings, generally being authoritarian and using punishment/reward, cry it out, etc.) I realize my parents have grown a lot and probably now recognize a lot of these aren’t healthy, and wouldn’t employ most of them on a grand baby. But it still leaves me a bit worried, because they’ll be spending a whole lot of regular time together.

So my question to you experienced parents is: if you’re raising your child as part of a village, did you make efforts to get your village on the same-ish parenting page as you? If so, what helped?

I have a sweet 8.5 mo old boy who will take nothing less than being nursed to sleep. Refuses bottles, formula, and pacifiers. You can maybe get him to take a stroller nap but it’ll last one cycle. He will fall asleep in the car as well after some intense screaming… Again for one cycle. The only way I’ve gotten him back to sleep for more than one cycle is in bed via the milk bar. Have tried rocking, patting, shushing, singing, and patting to no avail. 

So, he and I bedshare on my mattress on the floor. In a dark, cool, room with white noise.  Dad sleeps in another room bc he snores (real loud) yet also sleeps like a dead person (no joke).

Then he tends to stay up till 9 or 10 at which point he’ll go to bed 🤪

This had all been alright so far save for me feeling like I can’t really do anything while he’s asleep. Recently though, he’s gone back to waking up hourly and screaming if not able to latch immediately, believe this is the 8 mo sleep regression.

Mine’s non-existent but I figured that was the cost of entry for parenthood. I know this is just a season and I’ll look back sometime soon missing all the cuddles I get now, but I also can’t help but think about how I’d be a little (read: a lot) more productive if I had that time for myself. Can’t even ninja roll away because he kinda needs to be touching me. I play back our monitor in the morning and he gravitates toward me like a magnet no matter how far I move. 

He’ll learn how to fall asleep on his own eventually, I’m aware, and don’t get me wrong I love being his person more than anything (probably what I can’t stomach the most after the crying when I think about sleep training is if he’ll feel abandoned). It’s just starting to take its toll that this is all on me.

I guess I’m looking for advice? Success stories? Not really sure.

884,AttachmentParenting,"Hey everyone,
The TL;DR is the title :) 
This weekend my husband and I will be gone for a day and the kids will stay at our house with their grandparents.
Do you have any tips on how to make everything go smooth? I read How to talk so little kids will listen and I loved the idea to prepare kids for situations beforehand. 


So far I've made a word document where I wrote down everything that seems important (with pictures and a table of contents), I've collected enough milk so the 11 months old can comfort eat if necessary and I've talked to our almost 3 year old. I've drawn a timetable with her where I pictured what would happen and who will be part of what activity. She understood that we will leave and she'll spend a day with grandma and grandpa. Then we'll be back. I gave her the job to help grandma keep track on what's supposed to happen next and I included things for the baby (milk, diapers, naps), so she can ""help"" and find interesting things on the plan.

Right now she seems of two minds about it. First she really didn't like the idea of us gone, now after drawing that plan she's better and while she's still sad about us being away she also said that we'll be back and she'll have a great day with grandma and grandpa. Which sounds great, but I fear that will hit her once we're truly gone. 


What else can I do to prepare her? I want to find a good balance between discussing things (and hopefully having meltdowns with us instead of with the grandparents later) and not putting too much emphasis on the whole thing. It doesn't have to be bigger than it is. The way I know her it will be more difficult for me than for her and the baby.


Any tips? It's pretty daunting for me, since the kids aren't used to being without us or having others our them to bed. Sadly we couldn't do a test run yet. The grandparents are the only baby sitters we have and I don't want to overstate my welcome, so I limit it to the really necessary times. And the baby's sleeping habits changed a lot in the last few weeks (days even), so it would not have gained us much.",Any good tips on how to prepare kids for a day (and night) without parents?,1655840973.0

I normally wake about minimum 4 times a night. To feed (EBF) or to rock her back to sleep

I also need to be next to her when she wakes otherwise she will cry so much which can make it difficult to get her back to sleep.

I think it would help both him and me if I had an intentional plan for making this transition. I am a SAHM and also due with #2 in October so I certainly don't want to be trying this then. At this point we can still *usually* get him down for a late nap, but he's staying up later and later and the naps are getting shorter. He is perfectly fine on the days he skips a nap. I cannot possibly see him still napping come October.

Obviously I'm not going to just leave him in his room if he's upset. So, any suggestions on implementing quiet time with such a young kid? (we knew this day was coming when he went down to 1 nap at 6.5m.)

During the day we only contact nap because even if they are “asleep” the moment we transfer to bassinet they wake up and cry (is like they know we are putting them there)

At night up to a couple weeks ago they fell asleep between 11-12am and wake up twice once at 330-4am and once at 6-7.

Now a couple of weeks ago baby has been like fighting falling asleep. the best way I can describe is when we notice they are tired we hold them, and rock them and they are perfectly fine but right when they are about to fall asleep they start making these frustration noises. Almost like crying but not full crying. It also is now taking longer to finally fall asleep almost like 1am. but baby still wakes up at same hours 330 and 6.

Now the last two or three nights I put them on the bassinet asleep and five min later they wake up. They don’t cry and just like talk for like 10 and start sucking their hands very audibly. then again they start making these frustration noises. I wait until they start crying but the last 2 nights after a couple min of frustration they go quiet and fully asleep.

The ‘don’t ask, don’t offer’ technique is just not working, as he asks very very frequently. Dropping one feed at a time also isn’t working as the feeds are no longer time dependent but rather all day. Another more gentle technique I’m seeing a lot involves talking to him and explaining things but he either doesn’t understand yet or doesn’t want to. 

All that I can think of is cold turkey or bitter taste on the nipples, I know they aren’t allowed to be suggested in this sub (I think?) and I really don’t want to do either unless as a last resort.

896,AttachmentParenting,"My daughter is turning 9 months at the end of this week and she has been crawling for weeks now. She is incredibly mobile and already pulls herself to stand and side cruises. This has translated very quickly to tummy sleeping. We cosleep on a floor bed together. Most nights just me (mommy) and my baby. On weekends, Daddy joins us and I sleep in between them. 

I've always followed the SS7 and baby faces me on her side and I face her on my side, forming a little C shape and I nurse on demand (about once or twice a night now). 

My daughter keeps rolling onto her belly to sleep. She definitely prefers it. Sometimes she can't sleep or will be restless until she makes it to her tummy. I will move her to sleep in the way prescribed by SS7 but she sometimes still moves onto her back which seems less offensive but often, like right now, she rolled onto her tummy and turned her head away.

I feel like we can’t leave the house because she falls asleep in the car if we’re driving for more than 10 minutes no matter when her last nap was. Same goes for a walk in the stroller or a hike in a backpack. And if she naps like that it resets the wake window.

In the past week my two 6-month-old (almost 4 months corrected age) bubbas have gone from being excellent sleepers to barely sleeping at all. They only take around three 45 minute naps throughout the day and have an incredibly hard time getting to sleep, though if they were able to sleep on me, they'd probably sleep forever.

I always follow their sleep cues and while they almost manage to fall asleep on the boob, they no longer lay down to sleep when drowsy.

Apart from our two baby boys, we have a toddler, and I don't have the option of contact napping or letting baby sleep on the boob.

Babe has had a nanny since 9mo, currently 13m. The nanny has been with us for half days, three times every week, ie 12 hours total, with the exception of travels and such.

At 14.5m we’ll have to terminate our contract with the nanny because babe will start preschool full time.

Babe really likes the nanny, I would say that she is attached to some degree, they have so much fun together, and the nanny is really attentive and responsive to every little beep that babe makes. Babe is happy every time the nanny shows up and even often times prefers her over me when we’re all together.

I’m happy that they were able to connect so well, and I thought that it would be a great preparation for her starting preschool, in terms of dealing with a new caregiver. However, now she’s growing and understanding much more than I expected (I’m a ftm), and it has hit me that she might end up feeling abandoned by her nanny once the nanny stops coming? 

So far she’s been normal whenever the nanny is not around, and especially on whole weeks where we’ve been travelling (ofc without the nanny).

So my question is should I be worried for this upcoming separation? And what can we do to help babe with this transition? There will be a couple of weeks between the nanny’s last shift and when preschool starts, where we’ll be traveling.

Edit: we live in Sweden, so maybe preschool is different here than the US, and there might be a confusion over that.

914,AttachmentParenting,"My 2 and some year old HATES sleep. Ever since he figured it out he tries to keep himself awake. He literally cries when he sees someone in a book sleeping and tells them to wake up. Right before 2, bedtime became a proper battle, nursing but then falling asleep and then popping off to roll around and do whatever it took to wake himself up repeat for 1-2 hours. I cut nursing to sleep and things didn’t improve much. Bedtime continued to become a horrible battle. Falling almost asleep and then kicking blankets off to crawl away. 

We have tried a later bedtime, an earlier bedtime, keeping things crazy consistent, trying to follow his cues, a weighted blanket. Playing music, playing stories, singing, silence on and on. Shortening nap, making it longer, making it earlier, making it later. We haven’t tried cutting it because he still falls asleep like a dream, so easy for nap and so really seems to need it. He acts the same what no matter whose putting him down. If anything there’s even more fuss if husband tries. 

I sleep with him at night, I’m basically always there he might wake up for a minute but I’m always in the next room over. There’s been no changes at home. I don’t know why he hates sleep so much!! 

He recently had blood work done and is fine on all fronts. Eats great, loves veggies and everything. I don’t think his diet is missing anything. 

So any advice would be welcome. I don’t want to shut the door and lock him in his room but man am I getting close to feeling like that’s my only option! Kids only clocking 11hrs a day and some days has bags under his eyes.

921,AttachmentParenting,"I've been using the Huckleberry app for nap scheduling for our 11mo old, which has been super helpful in planning out our day, work schedules, to share with grandma, etc. 

Basically the app follows wake windows and predicts baby's next nap. It's usually correct down to the minute, which is fantastic for our day to day tasks. But (seemingly) out of nowhere, baby is struggling to fall asleep almost every night. He used to do pretty well, just a wee rock, pop him on the boob and he's out. Now we're spending almost an hour singing, rocking, and bouncing while he fusses & flails, which has been really hard on my back. 

So what I'm thinking we're doing wrong: 
The nap app says a different bedtime almost every night. It's usually around 8pm, but could be 7:15, 9pm, tonight it was 6:20... It's all based off of what time he woke from his afternoon nap. And since the Almighty Nap App has been so helpful over the past 10 months, I was hesitant to disobey it. Now I'm wondering if we're fucking up by not having a consistent bedtime. 

Today we tried putting him down around 6:30pm (about 10 minutes after the app said) and he was NOT having it. Husband suggested we let him stay up longer and play-- we stayed up til 8:15 (almost two hours later than Huckleberry suggested! Panic!) and he was asleep, relatively easily, by 8:30. 

I think I've been so worried about having him get ""overtired"" like all the books warn you about, but maybe what I think is overtired is just normal ""small human before bed"" energy?

Our baby girl is 7 weeks old, a difficult time as is, and the only thing that will make her not cry at the moment is being rocked while walking pretty much constantly. It is difficult as hell, and today, while me putting her against my chest either in a wrap or just holding her while I walked about and sang to her would be enough to calm her (I wouldn’t be able to put her down but she wouldn’t be actively crying), today even that hasn’t worked and she has been crying on and off for 9 hours. If I put her down even for a second to drink some water, she will howl. 

My husband is working from home today and I never ask for his help when he is as I understand he is working, and if he was in the office he couldn’t help anyway, the maximum I will ask is to bring me a glass of water. Today, after 8 hours of rocking her and her still not going down for a single nap (while all her other needs are met), I started crying as I am exhausted and emotionally drained. My husband made me the generous offer of watching her while I went to get a coffee and for a walk, but turns out what he meant was put her in her swinging chair and let her cry it out for 20 minutes. 

This isn’t new: everytime he offers to “help”, it’s not a genuine choice for me as I know he will just pop her down and let her cry, or if he is holding her, he will be rocking her absent mindedly while on his phone while she cries. 

It’s rare that he will actually do the this I know soothe her (mostly because they are tiring…), and when he does it will be for a short amount of time. 

Today he told me she will be fine if left to cry for a while every now and then, and doesnt understand he is not offering me a real choice or real help as I know if I leave her with him, my baby will be distressed. 

I have no other help and I am at my wits end. I never thought he’d be like this - I keep begging him to walk about with her a bit, I literally know what calms her down, and he says “I do you just never see it” (I am with them all the time), or claims she is calmed differently with him, but she never calms down when he just sits down and absent mindedly rocks her.

I am on my feet 12+ hours a day and I need help. He says I undermine him and make him feel like a bad dad if I “criticise” his parenting. He just threatened to go back to the office 5 days a week just so I can’t criticise him and so I can see “what it’s like to have no help.” 

I am sat on the couch as she naps for the first time today and crying my eyes out. I am exhausted and I now know I can never leave her with him as he’ll just let her cry and I feel desperate.

Hi all,

Today at my daughter's wellness visit the nurse advised me that 'babies die in our country due to suffocation during bed sharing' when I mentioned that we were bed sharing. She advised me to stay as far away from baby as possible when in bed with her, and said it was good my partner is not also in bed with us. I know it's just her job to tell me this, but I'm quite anxious about my baby's safety, and this upset me a fair bit - and irritated me because I feel like it's so disconnected from reality, when so many of us safely bed share, nurse to sleep and share beds with partners.

A friend directed me to a la leche league article that reassured me that bed sharing is just as safe as a cot with the safe sleep seven, after 4 months. She also helped me question my recent practise of letting my baby sleep on her tummy in our bed. I've been letting her do it in the hopes that she might finally have found a way to soothe herself back to sleep - I rationalised it that people say it's fine for a baby to sleep on her tummy if she gets herself there, so why would it be so much more dangerous in our bed sharing situation? My baby is 9 MTH, >10kg (22 pound), full term, EBF. I'm a light sleeper, always sober, don't move in my sleep. Baby wakes several times a night. She'll roll towards me and keep sleeping on her tummy sometimes, sometimes face down with her hands around her face, sometimes with her head to the side.

What are your thoughts? Do you know more about the rationale behind the sleep-on-back recommendation?

I feel like there is less talk about bed sharing with older babies. When do you feel it's safe to let them sleep on their tummy/however they want? My gut tells me that she'd just wake up if she was having trouble breathing, but I still worry.

931,AttachmentParenting,"This is our first baby. We have an 11 month old that we have not sleep trained. I do not support the crying out method for babies. I believe babies should be tended to and not left to cry. My husband is at wits end and we argue every time about sleep training (the cry it out method). 

You should know a little background before I get into it: my baby is still fully breastfed and will not go down for me for naps or at bedtime. She will only let my husband put her down to sleep. In the middle of the night when she wakes up I’ll tend to her but then he has to put her back down or she’s wide awake. 

(She gets up once or twice a night still) 

So it is his primary duty to get her and put her back to sleep when she wakes up which I understand can be annoying and frustrating. 

We argue almost every day about sleep training. He will let her cry for a while before getting her while I’m in the corner telling him to tend to her. Which then we get in the argument and my husband says: “if you don’t want her crying then you go get her:” 

Which I WOULD if she would sleep for me. But she doesn’t. 

So then that always starts the argument and he brings up all the research he’s done on sleep training and how doctors say it’s fine blah blah blah… 

We’re good parenting together but this is the one thing we just cannot agree on. I don’t know what else to do we argue argue about it and cannot come to a conclusion or middle decision. 

Any advice would be wonderful.

UPDATE: I think I was a little unclear in my original post from the advice below: I do take over for night duties. I get her 85% of the time when she wakes in the middle of the night. We do take turns. BUT I’ll rock her but she pushes off me. I breastfeed her and sometimes she goes back to sleep but MOST times she wakes up and pushes off me or is up and ready to play. She’ll only snuggle up to my husband to go back to sleep or down for a nap. 

Typically I’m up an hour or more with her and the second I hand her over to dad, she’s down. So yes, I get up with her but I usually have to wake my husband to finish putting her down. 😬

*Edit: Just taking a minute to note and acknowledge that, in my experience thus far, the real answer to stuff like this is to just wait and things change naturally over time. I strongly suspect things will just... adjust and get better as my LO continues growing.*

First, some background...

My LO has never needed much sleep. She's incredibly active, started walking/climbing/running around 8mo, and gets plenty of activity during the day. We have are fortunate enough throughout COVID to have grandma as nanny. As a result, she doesn't get much social interaction with toddlers, but plenty of interaction with adults and her older sibling (10 years).

For a while, she was going down for nap around 12:30pm, sleeping until around 2:30pm. Then she would do bedtime around 8pm and sleep until 6am. She would wake once in the night and we would just move her to our bed from the crib. She'd fall right back asleep.

Lately, her naps have gone to 12:15pm-1:30pm or so. Then bedtime is now 8pm-5am. Her night wake-up still happens too but I've noticed happens a bit earlier than usual.

We have the windows entirely blocked out. She's always had white noise. Lately, we started using a Hatch sleep light too. She understands the color system perfectly. Red means mom and dad aren't getting up yet. Blue means we can get up now. However, we cosleep... So a baby waking up in your bed and rolling around for an hour or so is still going to wake you up. We never get up, however, until the light is blue. She does understand that.

But I'm worried about two things:

**1) She's never needed much sleep, but this is very little even for her. I want to be sure she is getting what she needs.**

**2) I'm dying and these early mornings are killing me. An extra 30 minutes would make a massive difference.**

My only thoughts are maybe molars or developmental leaps. She doesn't really complain about pain or anything during the day, though. She's been a touch fussier than normal but, ultimately, a very happy baby.

He takes 5 or 6 30 minute naps throughout the day and wakes up between cycles every time; not allowing himself to get into a deep sleep ( the restorative kind he actually NEEDS) so by the end of the day he is inconsolable and crashes hard.

We have a 6.5yo cat & our puppy just turned 1yo. Our 1st pomeranian passed 1/2/2020 at 14yo & the 2nd passed 9/16/2021 at 14.5yo. We rescued a coonhound puppy on 9/17/2021. She had an extremely hard time with the entire situation & is still having some major jealousy issues. 

We've talked many times about how it's natural for her to be jealous, read books about it, talked with other kids her age about it so she can see she'snot alone in feeling that way. 

We are trying to have another child & will be starting fertility treatments in October of this year. She has begged & begged for a sibling for years & still does daily.

I don't know how to help her :( 

I'm 99% sure her hormones are starting to come because of the changes in attitude, sassiness & just general preteen stuff. She is normally a really good kid; asks to do laundry, cleans her bathroom without being asked, takes excellent care of the animals, loves school (she has been homeschooled since birth), is independent, kind, caring, loving & just all around an amazing human. One example of how amazing her heart is; it was our neighbors middle child's bday in Oct, she goes over there to play quite a bit & we didn't know it was his bday but as soon as she found out she walked home &  asked if she could give him some of her toys because it's his bday. She dug through her toys & found some cars & trucks to give him & made him a card. 

She gets jealous if we call the dog cute, a moose, a noodle, any nicknames that correlate to what the dog is doing, if the dog wants to sit by me or dad, if we talk to the dog like it's a toddler or baby, literally everything revolving around the dog. We make sure to give her extra attention too but nothing we've done has seemed to help & with her hormones coming in, it seems to be getting worse.

I'm not employed currently and my 3-year-old is also home full-time atm because the nursery/preschool doesn't have space yet. My baby is a contact napper and transferring him just doesn't work. Keeps waking up. My oldest was like this too, so it's not a surprise.

When I wear my baby I can cook and reach things that are counter top level but a lot of jobs are simply impossible. Like cleaning the toilet, picking things up the floor, reaching the freezer or low cupboards, vacuuming, toddler nappies/potty... Basically anything that involves leaning in and bending. When he is awake and not nursing, he does go on the floor and has a baby gym, but often doesn't last long before he wants to be picked up again - combination of reflux and my 3-year-old harassing him. Now, at first I was still squatting with him in the carrier but I've had to stop doing that as well as it completely wrecked my knees. My older son always wants me to come sit down with him for Lego play, books, etc. But I can't do that either as I can't get myself back up from the floor plus it disturbs the baby when I sit with him in the carrier. I can just about sit in a chair... Basically any simple thing becomes a struggle. I couldn't even load a dishwasher. Putting cookies in or out of the oven (low) while baby sleeps in the sling - it puts so much pressure on my knees.

She’s 99% EBF but we’ve recently increased formula to try and fill her up, she was an absolute angel newborn and slept SO well until this, we’re super responsive parents, she’s a happy baby and doesn’t cry unless something is legitimately wrong.

She doesn’t have any reflux, no teething (cutting anyway) at the moment, she’s learned to crawl over the last 2 months and just the last week to stand up. 

She’s been in her room in her cot since 14 weeks and we breastfeed to sleep. Solid bedtime routine - dinner, bath, boob, black room, white noise, humidifier, sleep suit.

Nothing changed other than her learning to crawl.

She started wanting to feed every hour-2 hours, her feed quantities have increased dramatically over the last week and she had a couple of good nights (bed at 7-7.30, feed at 12, feed at 5 with minimal wakes) but overall and especially the last 2 nights have been HORRENDOUS.

She wakes for a feed at 10-11, cries 5 minutes after going back into her cot. We settle her and she wakes again at 1-2, we feed and then she wont go back in her cot, just cries every 5-20 mins. Bring her in bed and she tosses and turns and rolls into me and wakes up annoyed. 

We can’t cosleep, I’ve tried, I cannot sleep like that and I don’t understand how anyone can lol. She wakes me up, I’m terrified of hurting her, our mattress is super squishy so she rolls around, when I try to just shift her a little away from me so I can sleep she may as well be back in her cot - cries.

I am just so so drained by the sleep things and I don't know what we need. We have no nap or sleep schedule because LO's sleep lengths vary so much so the times she gets sleepy changes all the time. She wakes up all through the night and doesn't sleep much at all during the day. She fights naps and bedtimes and it has been getting more and more difficult to resettle her back to sleep during her night wakings.

Our simple bedtime routine looks like a diaper change, prayer, a story, feeding to sleep in my bed, then transferring LO to her crib with a paci in her mouth. When she fights sleep, (kicking, squirming, & vocalizing), I have to rock her/hold her for 30 mins-1 hour before she finally settles. Then, she wakes every 1-3 hours, and I would feed her back to sleep if it was 3 hours since her last waking. 

For naps, I try to put her in the crib but she only naps for 30 minutes without fail.

963,AttachmentParenting,"LO is 8 weeks and starting to sleep for longer stretches. We’re trying to get her to 4-5 hours for her main stretch as she often won’t go back down after we feed at that point cause she suffers from reflux so I will then hold her the rest of the night and she’ll sleep on and off. 

It’s my goal to respond to her as often as she needs and never let her go for more than a few minutes if she needs something. 

The last two nights around 2-3 hour mark, she’s started making her usual grunting sounds for about 15 min then falling back asleep. She makes these when she pees, poops, passes gas, or is having a reflux episode (most likely) —— if it continues and escalates to a cry, then she’s hungry. When it is any of the former it never lasts more than 5 minutes before she settles back down as the discomfort subsides (hence why I wait a few).

My worry is that because the grunts are continuing 15-20 min (beyond her usual 5 min for bodily function) that she’s actually hungry and just giving up and falling back asleep without being responded to. However when she wakes later at the 4-5 hour mark, she does escalate to a brief cry and I hear her sucking her hands a bit so I know 100% by then what she needs. I do worry that these signals mean I let it go too long though. 

My other thought is that if she’s so tired that she’s falling back asleep (or never fully waking and just grunting in her sleep) at the earlier time, maybe it’s better she continue sleeping as we’ll be up in 1-2 hours for a feed anyway and she gets cluster fed from 5pm-bedtime. 

I know she’s getting plenty of food and I don’t know 100% if these earlier grunts are hunger based or from bodily functions/reflux. I just don’t want to ignore her wake cues and accidentally sleep train her, even if it’s happening sort of naturally (I.e. the grunting never gets to a volume that would reasonably wake us up, I just sleep light and normally wouldn’t respond to grunts until she makes it clear that she needs something versus is just grunting from pressure/discomfort).

I want to make sure she always gets responded to but don’t want to wake/rouse her unnecessarily. 

1. Would like to know your thoughts on this as attachment focused parents - should I worry about not responding to her here? 

2. And how do you differentiate signs of wake and sleep in your baby while also reasonably responding? Particularly if you had a noisy reflux baby…

972,AttachmentParenting,"I’m a FTM and my LO has recently turned 10 months, we EBF, she contact naps (has to stay attached the full duration or she’s wakes) and we also co sleep. She’s recently got her first tooth and I think more are possibly coming as she’s chewing and drooling a lot but still a happy little girl.

The only way I can get her to sleep is feeding to sleep in bed otherwise she is so nosey and will not sleep. This past week she has been really fighting her second nap, her 1st nap is always between 2-3 hours after waking and she goes over quite quickly. The second nap is generally 3-3+ hours after waking, however lately she will not sleep. I stay up in bed with her for 1-2 hours hoping she will settle, keeping my eyes closed, white noise, darkened room (as much as can be in the summer) but she just crawls all over me, pulling and blowing raspberries until I give up and go back downstairs. This means my baby is then fully up for a period of 7-8 hours! 

By 6.30 she is totally wrecked so I get her top and tailed, changed and up to bed were she will feed to sleep quite quickly. She does feed frequently throughout the night (I’m possibly a pacifier?) anywhere from 4-6 times but doesn’t fully waken unless I try not to give her the breast due to her not taking much interest in solid foods during the day and I thought maybe the reason for this is that she is feeding from me too much at night.

Is my LO getting enough sleep? She can’t be going down to one nap already?

973,AttachmentParenting,"My son is 21 months and we have been going to the same church every Sunday for the past 6 months or so.

I tried today to leave him by himself in the nursery and he FLIPPED out. I could hear him screaming from inside the auditorium. I have never heard anyone else's child from inside the auditorium.

974,AttachmentParenting,"Any advice would be greatly appreciated. For context, my son is 3.5 and his little brother is just shy of 1. I have sensory issues that affect my day to day life. My son is in occupational therapy and also has sensitivities as well. He’s a great kid overall, but lately he’s been not listening at all. (The next part might be a bit lengthy, so I’m about to rant a bit)

Everything’s a battle. And it’s not just “no” because that’s one thing. It’s screaming. About everything. For example, just now I heard him screaming my name from the back patio where he’s playing. My husband goes to check on him because I just got little brother to sleep in my arms. He proceeds to yell at him that he needs me because he’s done. Refuses dads help in anyway. Comes in himself and then comes and fusses at me to watch a show while brother naps. I say no. He screams YES. Then keeps opening the curtain to let sun in. I tell him to stop and he keeps doing it. Then he screams that it’s cold, to turn the heat on. It’s just never ending screaming. 

The other thing he does is I’ll tell him something and he won’t respond at I’ll. I’ll say “okay?” Nothing. I’ll ask again and he’ll scream at me “okay! I heard you! I said okay!!!!” And he acts like he’s been responding the whole time. When in fact he’s been dead silent and I don’t know if he’s listening at all. 

Part of it is I know that he’s overtired. But he refuses to nap. He just gets progressively worse throughout the day. Less listening. More chaotic. Running into his brother and knocking him down. Screaming. I’ll tell him to use his inside voice and I’m met with a scream of “okay!!! I am!!!!” 

I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t want to yell, I don’t want to hit. I don’t do timeouts alone. But I feel like I’m about to lose my cool. I had to sit in the bathroom and cry after fighting him to go potty and then he kept touching my face. When he finally left I just sat and cried.

976,AttachmentParenting,"For a multitude of complicated reasons, I am likely going to be starting a job soon that would bring me back into the office. My baby would be staying at home with his work from home dad. The issue is that my toddler(20mo) is still breastfeeding A LOT and has never been apart from me for more than 2 hours. Breastfeeding is a very important part of our connection and relationship and I don’t want to stop. I plan on pumping when I go back into the office but I worry so much about my LO and how he won’t have me for comfort nursing during the day. I should be able to get a long enough break to come home and nurse him to sleep for his nap like I usually do. But a big problem is he often nurses throughout his nap and especially as he’s waking up. When I’ve had to be out of the house for naps or even in the other room and he wakes up and I’m not there he gets so scared and is nearly inconsolable for my husband(who, I’ll add he does have a great relationship with). My toddler has been not too keen on pacifiers lately either which makes things hard and he won’t make any real attachment to stuffed animals or lovies no matter how hard I try.

I say I think because I work full time (Mon-Fri 9-5), I get home to do the cooking, or just generally take up my share of the work around the house until dinner (either something I have cooked then, or prepared earlier), then it's bathtime (my partner bathes with him every day as part of his routine), then bedtime. Our son bedshares until he is deep asleep at which point I will transfer him to his SnuzPod until he wakes up to feed or seek comfort (usually 3 or so times a night), until between 3 and 4 when I go to our spare bedroom to get a couple hours of solid sleep before I get ready for work.

I don't spend much quality time with him during the week, is what I'm getting at. Days are a rush and nights are a slog of trying to get him to sleep for a longer period of time. I spend a huge amount of time during my working hours thinking about him and my partner, and I miss him terribly, and my colleagues would be the first to say I barely talk about anything else.

But when the weekend rolls around I become a short-tempered, miserable ogre of a person, barely able to enjoy any time with him. He isn't an easy baby, he whines and gets upset easily and is generally  a bit neurotic, but my partner and I are committed to attachment style parenting which, whil emaybe exacerbating these issues in the short term, will hopefully provide him a solid base of confidence and trust that he can venture out and know that we will be there to support him.

I suffer from depression, and am a recovering alcoholic (13 1/2 months). I have spent a number of years in counselling to address my issues.

And I don't act in a (for lack of a better term) selfish way at all. I will always go along with my partner's or someone else's plan. I find it nigh impossible to say ""No, I want to do my own thing"" or ""I want to be by myself for a while"". This is made harder for me because my partner doesn't seem to want her own time.

I have been keeping her bedtime routine pretty regular since we have gotten out of the newborn phase. Get her in a fresh diaper and pajamas, sleep sack, lay her down with me to nurse and snuggle, then once she is asleep, I lay her down in her crib next to my side of the bed. The process takes 45 minutes to an hour start to finish. 

Cut to this week. Suddenly when we lay down to nurse and snuggle, she wants to nurse FOREVER. She can be sound asleep, like I lift her arm and drop it, and she does not budge. But the very second I remove my nipple from her mouth, it's game over. She starts flailing her arms to find it again and wakes back up. Bedtime is taking about 2 hours or longer now, and it's making me a little crazy. She isn't acting fussy or upset. She just does not want to let go of me.

983,AttachmentParenting,"Along the lines of things we’re tired of hearing from people, this honestly isn’t the worst per se. I just can’t help but think it’s a bit of a terrible thing to assign “good” and “bad” values to babies, especially when it’s really shorthand for “easy”.

My MIL is constantly telling us how lucky we are that we have such a good baby, and we definitely are lucky to have a relatively easy baby. When she says that, I can’t help but think:  what if he wasn’t so easy? Would he then not be a “good” baby?

It makes me feel so sad for those not-so-easy babies. They’re often less easy because they’re suffering more or they just need more from their caregivers than other babies.

986,AttachmentParenting,"What did it look like for your little one?
And/or any sleep advice you have, let me know.
My daughter is 3 1/2 months and about two weeks ago, after finally  giving us a week or two long stretches of sleep at night (6-8 hrs), had an intense growth spurt and rough sleep, sometimes waking every hour to eat for a week. Then she started occasionally giving us those long stretches again, last night being 9.5 hrs. But every two or three nights she wakes up every single hour or even 40-59 minutes, maybe a 2-3 hr stretch thrown in there if lucky. So it seems some night she connects sleep cycles, others she doesn’t. Like tonight, she’s waken every sleep cycle so far, like wiiide awake.

I’m trying to figure out what I’m doing differently these days. Her naps are inconsistent, so maybe that’s part of it?

I always feed her to sleep after a bath and a song (a book too if she’s more awake still) and transfer her to crib after 15-20 min of holding her. I do this again for wakings (just the nursing to sleep part i mean), as the night/morning goes on it’s harder to get her back in crib so I eventually hold her the last 1-4 hours. I’ve tried sleeping with her in bed following the safe 7 but it’s hard to feed her with side lying cause of my huge chest so I have to stay awake anyway while she’s feeding and now she likes to sleep in her side which seems safer in her crib (I put her down on her back).

Naps are contact naps from 20min-2.5, even 3 hours. Occasionally I transfer to crib but my husband is more successful for example today while I was at therapy for my pelvic floor.

Edit to add: my one guess is she is simply hungry when she wakes every cycle. Cause when she doesn’t, she just stirs a little in between cycles and sucks her thumb to sleep, I guess satisfied just by sucking cause she’s not hungry. But other nights she tries to do that and gets frustrated with her thumb and eventually cries out for me so I get her and she’s intensely hungry most of the time so of course her thumb wasn’t enough.",4m sleep regression?,1654230588.0
